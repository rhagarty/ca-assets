I ordered one bottle last month, and was pleased enough that I ordered three more.  However, this recent order came with all three items being packaged in plastic jars, whereas the first was in a glass jar.  I prefer the glass, which is why I ordered again.  However, the shipping was fast and the quality of the oil appears to be the same.  Overall happy with product, but will seek out glass jars in future."}
