It has a light coconut hint at times.  I use it for popping corn and I can't taste any coconut, other items like meats or veggies sometimes have a hint of coconut...it's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />I thought I would save washing a spoon each time I used this and put in a clear, plastic spoon (Kirkland brand) into the jar so I could reuse it.  DON'T KEEP PLASTIC IN YOUR COCONUT OIL!!! About 1 week later I went to make popcorn and I pulled out the handle of the spoon with no bottom of the spoon to be found!!!  The acid in the coconut oil will eat away at certain plastics! Had to throw the 1/2 full jar away!  Lesson learned!  Just reordered and went on subscribe and save."}
