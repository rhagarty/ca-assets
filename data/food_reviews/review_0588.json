I love baking with it so much. The smell is fabulous! However, after reading about ALL the other uses for coconut oil I decided to get the two jar option so I could have one in the kitchen and one for personal care. I tried the oil as a lotion for the first time today and I'm totally hooked. Not only is my skiing oh so soft, but the smell is fantastic (not overwhelming at all). Now my only concern is getting more oil soon."}
