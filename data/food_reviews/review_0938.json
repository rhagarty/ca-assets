At that point, the ends become terribly brittle & eventually fray. However, that's no longer a problem since I started using coconut oil as a deep conditioner. The jar says to apply 1-2 hours before washing your hair, but it's obviously better if you leave it in longer. After one use (overnight), my split ends were substantially reduced, all the strands felt smooth from root to tip, & my waves were at their bounciest! Not only is it the most effective solution I've come across, it's also natural & the cheapest.<br /><br />I can't really comment on its other curative properties aside from skincare. I would advise against it in favor of jojoba oil. Coconut oil is heavier & may clog pores. However, it doesn't deserve to get knocked for that considering how well it works on hair.<br /><br />Also, the oil will congeal if it gets in the low 70s. Don't freak out, it's still good & less messy to apply since you can get a good amount on your fingers. If you can't get down like that, just put it in hot water & it will return to its liquid state. Oh, and be careful if you intend to take it as a supplement. You have to ease your body into it & only take a little at a time, like if you're trying to build an immunity to arsenic. Unknowingly, I took the recommended amount (jar, I trusted you!) & proceeded to have my insides torn apart.<br /><br />So, if you can remember these tips, you'll be well on your way to beautiful hair!"}
