A nutty flavor with wonderful texture.  I never realized how bland some oatmeal was until I tried this brand.  This is a long cooking oatmeal but worth the wait.  I think that precooked oatmeal has too many nutritients removed in the process. If you want fiber in your diet, this is one of the best sources available and low calorie if don't add in butter or cream.  I always make a big pot of it so it lasts the week.  I add jam or preserves for sweetness and sometimes maple syrup or honey.  Fresh fruit when in season really is great or spices for a change. Since we use it daily, the 28 ounce tins are the most economical especially if on sale."}
