But you can get the exact same stuff much cheaper. As of Nov 2011 the Amazon price works out at around $3.70/lb. (4 x 28oz cans for $26). I have found you can get steelcut oatmeal from a grocery store that has dried goods in bins (Sprouts Market in Los Angeles CA in my case) for $0.99/lb.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
