I also cook with it a little and it isn't too strong, although I keep thinking I smell like a large macaroon after I rub this in to my hands and arms. (It fades in a few minutes)  I've started giving it to my very old and very finicky cat, who to my surprise and delight, enjoys licking it off my fingers after she eats her dinner.  Her digestion has improved and it helps her keep a little weight on.  I would definitely buy this again!"}
