Storage ok so far with our<br />house temp under 76 degrees. During the summer will have to refrigerate it to keep it solid. Great flavor with all meats-beef, fish, chicken; adding to oatmeal.  Too bad the prices are going up everywhere including this product on all Coconut oils sold.  This is the best price for this brand so far.  Will continue to use it unless the price keeps going up."}
