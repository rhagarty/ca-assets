Usually use products that contain coconut oil.  I found this to be a great moisturizer for both skin and hair, and it smells wonderful.  Both my young nieces use it for their skin and also love it.  One of my nieces thinks it smells like pound cake!  It is an oil though, so it's hard to use as a moisturizer right out of the jar, so I put it in a spray bottle.  Much better.  I recommend this for a good moisturizer."}
