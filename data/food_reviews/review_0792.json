And then of the types she can eat that don't cause a case of colon-blow, she only likes a few..even the crazy expensive, vet-recommended brands and organic brands, etc.  Beneful is the one food that seems to be perfect, her sweet spot for no digestive issues.  She doesn't stink me out of the house.  She is regular and not that poo is ever not gross, but at least I an pick it up at the park without an issue.<br /><br />She likes every flavor and the pieces are small enough that my smaller dog (1.5 lbs) has no problem with them.<br /><br />LOVE BENEFUL...every flavor.<br /><br />This Amazon price is currently about $4 cheaper than my local grocery store which is more expensive per pound but smaller bags than Costco.  I like the smaller bags."}
