Then Wedderspoon made changes that I find unacceptable. The first had to do with their label, which most people don't bother to read since the label color didn't change. Gone was organic certification by Ecosert SA. Gone was \"Support the OMA mark which guarantees honey that is free from chemicals and pesticides.\" Missing are the following: Never feeding the bees sugar, area of forage is 5 km. from intensive farming, Ecosert approval. Added was the word \"harmful\" before chemicals and pesticides. Obviously, chemicals and pesticides are added and we are supposed to hope they are not harmful.<br /><br />Then I noticed that batch 110576 was definitely \"watery\" compared to earlier batches. It had nothing to do with the weather because last summer was just as hot and the manuka was just fine. Batch 110583 was almost as runny as 110576. Then came another shipment from Amazon.com that was packed very securely, but there was leaked honey all over the box. Amazon.com reimbursed me, but it wasn't their fault. The outer seal was intact but there was no inner seal. This runny honey had no difficulty passing between the jar and the cover.<br /><br />Additionally, although it no longer affects me, it appears that Wedderspoon followed through and no longer sells direct to Amazon.com, which raises the price a little more.<br /><br />I rated this product one star so I could submit my review. One star is very generous.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
