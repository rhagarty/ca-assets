Well worth the cooking time for sure, great extra nutty taste if you toast the cut oats in a dry skillet before using!<br /><br />I definately recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy and enjoy your meal in the process.<br /><br />You could soak the oats before going to bed in the appropriate amount of water for a shorter cooking time in the morning but I don't care for the texture when prepared that way; to close to that of rolled oats if you get my drift."}
