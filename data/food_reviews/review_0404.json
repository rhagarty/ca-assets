I am huge with natural skin care and I have been using honey as a face mask (which I love), but it is just too messy and sticky. I research constantly for new things for natural skin care and I came across coconut oil; I just have to say I was skeptical at first, but I absolutely love this product! I don't break out a lot, just a few on my chin every now and then, but it is usually painful cystic acne and after applying this at night the next morning I woke up and my face was glowing, I couldn't believe it! I don't have wrinkles, but I was getting a few fine lines under my eyes and they have disappeared after only four days of using this at night before bed and in the morning after my shower. I am absolutely amazed, this is a miracle product! I also use it as a moisturizer and hair mask. I have my mom and sister-in-law using this now and they said the same thing! I recommend this product to anyone! Also, I got the 15 oz jar which will probably last months because you only need a tiny tinyyy bit for your face"}
