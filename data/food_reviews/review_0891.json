And way less expensive than the local grocery store.","text":"This oatmeal is great. It is a lot more flavorful than typical oatmeal. I heard about it on Oprah and gave it a try from our local store, but paid a lot for it. I saw I could get it from Amazon in bigger bulk but much less per can in the end, so I stocked up. I save the leftover cans as decoration for my kitchen. They look like something you'd get from an old five and dime store and I love that.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
