The many uses of this product; training, feeding, tug, play, fetch, etc.. are incredible considering the low price of it.  Ingenious design and functionality.  Be sure to use (smelly) smaller treats to have your dog get the \"hang\" of it and adjust them in size to make it more challenging.  Trust me, if you put just a little time into showing your dog how it \"works\", it will easily become its favorite toy. The BEST!!!!!!"}
