I had not used it for making popcorn until recently and I must say it makes a healthy nutritious snack even more delicious than ever!  It is great for baked goods as well. Obviously, I find it extremely versatile.  The 2 pack is such a nice option. It saves me time and money.  Can you tell ,...?  I Love It !!!"}
