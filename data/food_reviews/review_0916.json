I am trying to eat healthier and find better alternatives to eating organic as well as preserve the taste of food, or even better, make it tastier.  Although it has been just a bit challenging to eat organic and also consume healthy, tasty products, this has made cutting fast foods completely out TOTALLY WORTH IT. I cannot believe I have never cooked with coconut oil before.  I used it with my ordinary seafood dish and popcorn butter substitute.  It melts immediately and adds a crisp to whatever savory dish you are making.  The faint, but identifiable taste of coconut oil makes the dish even BETTER.  SERIOUSLY, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?  With all the positive reviews, purchasing an item for the first time can be a tiny, wee bit difficult for a newbie.  However, if you are planning to eat healthy and use better cooking alternative oils and saturate your food with a bit more fat (good fat), use coconut oil.  Since this was the brand and product that immediately popped up when I was looking for coconut oil, I will say this is a very high quality and yummmmmmy item to purchase.  I will definitely incorporate more coconut oil in most of all my dishes as I cook many of meals.  Although I have not yet cooked a sweet dish using coconut oil, I am assuming it will be quite delicious as well.  I still cannot get over how additionally tasty my food is with this new additional to my cooking ingredient cart.  So worth it...I recommend this product to everyone and will be talking my family into this cooking alternative immediately.  Delicious and healthy."}
