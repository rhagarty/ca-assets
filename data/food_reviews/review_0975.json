It has made my hair healthier, stronger and softer. I also use it to pop popcorn. Gives it an excellent flavor- so much better than butter. And healthier. My puppy loves coconut oil too. Anytime I am in the bathroom conditioning my hair with it she will run in and beg for a bite. She's very healthy, has a beautiful coat and is energetic. I think this product is working well for both of us!!"}
