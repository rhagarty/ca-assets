I would buy it much more!  At least on Amazon you get a better price than in the store.  At Whole Foods this same honey is over $40.00!!!  Yikes!<br />I love that it is raw & organic.  It is a thick cloudy honey that has a wonderful taste with a little bite at the end.  My mouth waters just thinking about it!  I also love how it's a bit thick because it makes it much less messy.  Talk about wanting to take your medicine!  It recommends you take a teaspoon a half hour before eating.  No problem!  I do it gladly!<br />I haven't noticed any health changes, but I'm sure it must be doing good things.  Honey is known for it's health benefits & this stuff is supposed to be amazing!  Maybe it takes a while for the health benifits to be noticeable.<br />If you can afford it & like honey, I would buy it in place of other honey just for it's yummy taste & if it makes you healthier than bonus points!"}
