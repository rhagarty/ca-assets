My two oldest dogs LOVE this and my two youngest dogs seemed to not really care either way. My two oldest dogs also seemed more energized and happier. Will have to probably keep this on hand for those two. Overall not a bad change and glad to find something my two eldest babies enjoy, that makes it worth it in the end."}
