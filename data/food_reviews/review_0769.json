This is my second bottle but the consistency of the honey is far different from the first one I ordered.  This bottle of honey is thin and runny - much more like a sauce than a real honey consistency, and lighter in color.  I have never seen honey this texture in my life.  A new Whole Foods just opened up nearby and I purchased a bottle of Wedderspoon 16+ there.  When this bottle runs out, I will be very interested to see what texture the one purchased at Whole Foods looks like.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
