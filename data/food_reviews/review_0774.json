They go through bags and bags of food and usually I have to buy the real cheap stuff. My dogs loved this stuff, though I still had to mix it with half a can of wet dog food to get them to eat it. They are kind of picky eaters, but then again, they would eat just about anything if it was soaked in enough lard. The main reason I don't buy this stuff is because I can't afford it, but if I could afford it, I would get it for them.<br /><br />Reading the ingredients, I see that it contains real beef and highly digestible egg, but it also includes crunchy corn, tomatoes, spinich, and oatmeal. There are omega fatty acids, along with antioxidants like Vitamin E and selenium. I have been trying to find out just exactly what antioxidants are, and why we need them. My dogs could care less, but I am sure they appreciate things like linoleic acid if it results in a shiny coat. How about that beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols? What is that all about?<br /><br />Anyway, thanks Purina Beneful, for providing my 4 K-9s with an excellent bag of dog food that provided them endless hours of dining pleasure."}
