I have a 7 month old lab, and he can't figure out how to get the food out very well.  It's kinda hard for me too--I have to hold the rope part with one hand and shake the bottle with the other hand.  So I can see why it's hard for dogs.  But anyway--the product is very durable, and maybe Samson will learn the trick one day."}
