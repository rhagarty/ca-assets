Yes they stink<br />when you open the bag... big deal, rinse them well and boil or nuke and drain well, and you won't<br />smell them afterwards.  The real reason for getting these is for meals where you want something like<br />a lean cuisine to make you feel more full.  I have had no nausea or any affects from eating these as<br />some have posted, and I eat two bags at a time.  If you are not on a diet... why in the world would<br />you even buy these, and then post how terrible they are??  For a low calorie diet, these are a great<br />way to curb the appetite when mixed with small portions of tasty foods!"}
