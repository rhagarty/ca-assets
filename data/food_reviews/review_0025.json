We try to buy interesting and safe toys for us to give her while we're at work. It's tough and has withstood our large Bernese Mountain dog puppy chewing at the neck of it and throwing it around the room. It took her a few days to figure it out.  I had to show her how to use it, and she seemed uninterested, but then I left it in her crate with her, and when I came home later it was empty.  Since then, she's a pro at it.  The rope didn't last that long, but we just took the rope out and use larger treats with it, and it's still a challenge for her.  Our last thing that we tried in it was baby carrots - she loved it and it took her a good 30 minutes to get them out."}
