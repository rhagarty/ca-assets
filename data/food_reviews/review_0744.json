I think my review might have been biased so I went to the dogs.  I have three and they all liked it.  They ate it and wanted more.  To bad I didnt give them any.  The biggest, Chief, gave it 2 paws up and well, tipped over sideways.  He was very happy with it though.  My smallest, Coco, decided to hide hers for later.  All in all it really is a good priced item and even though my dogs will eat anything they liked this stuff.  Nothing bad to say about it.  I tried it on one more dog, my parents, and she doesnt eat anything.  Well, she ate this stuff."}
