I was worried it might be too big for my little Maltese, but he LOVES this toy!  I especially use it when I'm going to be gone for a couple hours because I know it will keep him entertained and happy.  If we're going out for dinner, I put the dog's dinner portion of dry food (very small morsels) into the jug so he can play and eat while we're away.  I had been using empty bottles from bottled water for him, but they begin to splinter and break up after a couple of days and I worried about him swallowing broken bits of plastic (NOT good for the tummy!).  I don't have to worry about that with this VERY durable bottle.  It seems by looking at it that it would be impossible for the dog to get treats out of it, but my guy figured out within a day how to get out every last one.  A truly super item!"}
