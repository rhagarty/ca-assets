Amazing","text":"Miracle Noodles are calorie free noodles that are based on a very traditional Japanese food.  What this company has done is to make them more appealing to people in the west with various different shapes.  I saw them on the Talk with Rocco Dispirito as one of the recipes in his new book Eat This Now! Diet features Miracle Noodles.<br /><br />They take on the flavor of anything you cook them with BUT you must follow the instructions which are to rinse and boil for one minute then dry (this last step being very important)  They are mostly water so for me they work best in soups and casseroles.  Check out their facebook page for tons of recipes from customers.<br /><br />My father eats these since he is diabetic and my mother has lost lots of weight just eating these for lunch everyday.  As with anything, there is a learning curve with working with them, don't expect an Italian pasta right out of the bag, but with experimentation and the cookbook the company allows you to download on their website, as well as all the recipes from customers on the facebook page, you will find that you have just discovered a way to eat in an incredibly low calorie way that tastes great.  Isn't that all you could ask for?","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
