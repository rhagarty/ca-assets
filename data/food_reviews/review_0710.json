I'm a skeptic, if it sounds to good to be true...it probably is.<br />My mom has a stage II bedsore and while it's not as gross as the other stages, I knew it could get worse. I did lots of online research and kept coming across this 'Manuka Honey'.<br /><br />In the meantime all the hospital had given me for her wound, (sorry for the graphic detail), which is right at the crack of her butt , was a second skin type of material. This stuff has a slight adhesive that is supposed to stick to the skin without tearing it. The thing was that because of the location, it wasn't sticking and the wound was getting worse.<br /><br />Bottom line, this stuff ain't cheap, but it works. For those of you who have had experience with this sort of sore before know it can be a very long process to cure. I am happy to say that after 3 days of usage, I started seeing results! It's been almost 3 weeks now and almost all of the pinkness is gone and moms sore is about 1/4 the size it was before we started using Manuka.<br /><br />As a postscript, I had a cut on my hand and used it for a couple of days...it did the trick.<br />This is the real deal, and for those of you (like me) who care, it's holistic."}
