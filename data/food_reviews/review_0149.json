These ones DON'T. Straight glucomannan, water and calcium. They taste like nothing (this is a good thing) but the texture is just like all other shirataki noodles (gelatinous and snappy/crunchy). I recommend them if you are familiar with it, but if you aren't -- try the ones in the grocery store first to be sure.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
