(Another reviewer suggested inserting a tennis ball into the now-ropeless jug in order to salvage it; I'll try that, but am not enamored with the idea of mixing a tennis ball with edible things).  It seems to be his favorite toy -- a good balance of enticement, challenge and reward.<br /><br />PRO:<br />Keeps our dog engaged.<br />Good price ($10 currently)<br /><br />CON:<br />It can be loud rolling around and crashing into things.<br />Hard plastic should be washed before use; unknown chemical safety.<br />Limited durability, but fine for the price.<br /><br />Net: I'm ordering our third!"}
