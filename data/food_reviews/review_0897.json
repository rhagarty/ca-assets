I have not encountered any stale smell at all, as one review mentioned.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that most of my cans are dented.<br /><br />I would have rated the product higher, but until I start getting cans which have not been compromised (which I've requested), I can't rate this any higher than a generous 3 stars out of 5."}
