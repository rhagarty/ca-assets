Dr.Oz did a show on weight loss and these noodles were featured.  The only bad thing is the \"fishy\" smell when you open the package.  Rinse very well; drain; microwave for about 1 to 2 min. then I top with my own pasta sauce.  These are so filling, I can't even eat the whole package at 0 calories.  Enjoy!","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
