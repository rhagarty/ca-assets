I keep one jar in the bathroom to use as a moisturizer on my skin and hair and I keep one in the kitchen to cook with (although it's a little pricey to use as regular cooking oil).  It's great in oatmeal, on banana bread, or even crackers.  It tastes great and makes my skin glow.  I have recommended it to several friends."}
