They all love Beneful. I thought i would have some problems switching over to this as they had been used to another brand. But this was not the case, from the first time i gave it to them , they ate it with abandon and enthusiasm.<br /><br />The Beneful dog food is a nice tasting food for dogs I also know this because we have tried other dog foods with them and they didn't really like them . The packaging is a bit difficult to open and you will need another airtight container to store the food as the bag it comes with is not airtight and cannot be re-sealed once open. So i would reccomend an improvement in the packaging. From my Dogs perspective , its 5 stars based on taste, from mine 4 stars for the less than perfect packaging."}
