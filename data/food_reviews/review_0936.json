I use it on my and my baby after showers/baths and it has cleared up my skin from many different blemishes (Dry spots, red patches and red bumps I have had for years). I have also used it on my hair and it has helped get rid of the dry brittle frizz.<br />Since I use it everyday it has helped me not to get sunburned.<br />I also have used it on popcorn (so good) and with cooking rice. Can't wait to find more cooking uses for it.<br />Also a very good price and I love that I don't have to go to the store to get more when I run out."}
