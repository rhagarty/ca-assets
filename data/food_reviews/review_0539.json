It is great for cooking as a vegetable oil substitute and butter substitute in many recipes.  Of course it contains no salt, so if a recipe is counting on the salt from butter as flavor (easy example is toast), then you may want to add some salt separately.  But of course, most of us can use less salt in our diet.<br /><br />Also, this is great for dry skin.  It might take a few (5-10) minutes to absorb completely, but it works wonders."}
