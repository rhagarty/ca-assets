The taste and scent was extremely pleasant.  No after taste, just delicious.  I took a teaspoon before breakfast and before dinner.  On first day, I got diarrhea immediately after dinner. I tried it again same routine.  Stomach begin to grumble after dinner again and I got diarrhea.  Tried it the third day but with a piece of toast.  Third day, after dinner stomach ache and to bathroom again.  I decided not to try it the following day.  Had no stomach problems.  Tried it again the following day before dinner only and had to  'visit' bathroom again immediately after dinner.  I continued for about 2 weeks and bathroom routine occurred almost nightly (even though I had used bathroom several times already earlier in the day).  So for me, this product seems to act as an agent to clean my system (seems like an expensive laxative ;o).  NOTE:  My objective USE of this product was to alleviate mild arthritic pain that occurs in my knee during extremely cold days.  I noticed no change in the pain when using this product.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
