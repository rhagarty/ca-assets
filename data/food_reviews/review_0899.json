Packaging lousy!","text":"Ordered 8 cans (to qualify for free shipping). Virtually every one was dented from being banged around. Cereal was fine but the packaging was terrible.<br /><br />The oatmeal itself is great. Pour a 1/2 cup in boiling water and turn heat down to lowest simmer, stir occasionally for 15-20 mins. Knocks the socks off Quacker Oats for taste (as far as oatmeal has \"taste\").","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
