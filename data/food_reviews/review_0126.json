They are meant for Asian stir fry and soup dishes.<br /><br />Also they smell terrible when you open the bag and you either have to run them under hot water or boil them first to get rid of the smell.<br /><br />Once they are washed they offer a neutral flaovr and can be added to any stir fry as a replacement for rice noodles.<br /><br />I would not purchase these again as I think the flavor is not good and you don't get enough for what you are paying for. The packs are ridiculously small."}
