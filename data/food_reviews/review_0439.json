I paid $10 for an 8-oz jar in the local stores!<br /><br />I love cooking with this product. Scrambled eggs seem to come out very fluffy.<br /><br />I will warn new users to not use coconut oil on very light foods, as the oil does have a slight coconut taste and fragrance. In other foods, the taste disappears completely.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
