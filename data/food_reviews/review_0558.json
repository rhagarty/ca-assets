It is a really GOOD deep conditioner for my hair. I use one jar for my hair and skin and the other jar for cooking. I am greatful to Allah for this product. For my hair, it adds shine and strengthens my hair and conditions my scalp very very very well. Plus, it softens my skin. For cooking, it is way better than butter. I really like the taste of this product, fresh and pure. For me, it has replaced my hair conditioners and it has replaced butter!! Really like the health benefits of using Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. The product arrived on time wothout being busted up or dented. Product came with an under cap seal to lock in freshness. I am very very HAPPY with the seller. Excellent price (free shipping); and excellent product. I will buy more of this product in the future. Thank you again Amazon! :)"}
