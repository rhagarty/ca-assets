We've always eaten the rolled oats and wondered how steel cut oats could be so much better.  Well, they do take a little longer to cook, but no worse than cooking brown rice, and just as easy.  Since our mornings require a quick breakfast I cook a batch (four cups of water, one cup of oats)in the evening and store it in a covered container in the fridge, the next morning we scoop out a serving, heat in the microwave for a minute stir in sugar and cinnamon then add milk.  This makes four hefty servings.  Now eating it requires some time.  You don't just swallow this stuff like the regular rolled oats you may already be accustomed to.  They have a great slightly chewy quality and a great nutty taste that rolled oats just don't seem to have.  McCann's steel cut oats are to be savored.  Don't microwave it long, just enough to warm it.  I'll reserve the old rolled oats for oatmeal cookies, but McCann's is for breakfast from now on at our house. Hubby likes it with one or more of these additions: chopped dates, chopped figs, pecans, raisins, dried cranberries, chopped apples, cinnamon.  It's seems more like a dessert.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
