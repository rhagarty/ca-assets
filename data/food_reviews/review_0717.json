And last but not least I LOVE Amazon's quick shipping & not having to lug a huge bag in & out of the car up stairs etc!!<br /><br />If Amazon prices are similar to local store prices I ALWAYS opt for Amazon, it not only saves gas but my time and energy, which I am always in short supply of these days!"}
