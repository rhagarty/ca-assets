It just looks right. It tastes right. It smells right. You can tell they're not lying when they call it raw. I love it, and my Aunt who was diagnosed a few months ago with lung cancer (she's ok, thank God) has been taking a spoon or two of this daily. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the honey, pomegranate, olive oil and just generally healthy, non-processed foods she's been eating exclusively helped her reduce the cancer cells moreso than the medicine the doctor prescribed her.<br /><br />If you're looking for honey, look no further."}
