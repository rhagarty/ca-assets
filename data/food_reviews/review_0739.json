He isn't a real picky eater, but he does have his favorites when it comes to dog food. I wouldn't say he'll eat anything you put in front of him, but if I want to see him eat from his own dog bowl right when I put food in it, then Beneful is the dog food of choice. All other dog foods sit there for hours or until the end of the day before he'll go eat...out of hunger mostly. I'm happy we finally have a dog food Taz will actually eat the second we put his bowl down on the floor for him.<br /><br />I've also noticed his weight is under control, meaning he isn't getting too thin or fat. Taz is at a healthy weight and has lots of energy...like when he was a puppy. (Taz is 5 years old now)<br /><br />If you have a dog who doesn't like their dog food, I suggest trying Beneful. They have many flavors to choose from. My dog likes this one best, but he will eat the others too."}
