I got the oil to use in a recipe for a pie crust.  Since yesterday I have tried it on my hair, skin, and on toasted cinnamon bread.  I was surprised at how great it smelled, but I was blown away by how yummy it TASTES!  I really wish that I would have bought a bigger jar!  This will be something that I continue to use for a long time!  Thanks Nutiva and Amazon!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have used my 15 oz. jar in 2 months and I am now ordering the 54 oz. jar...  I am blown away at how delicious this stuff is.  I eat it on toasted bread ALL the time.  I also use it on baked sweet potatos, baked butternut squash, and to cook pancakes on the stove.  My skin and hair are considerably softer!  I want to tell everyone I know about this stuff."}
