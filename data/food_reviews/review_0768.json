Having said that, my dog chows (pun intended) this down just like any other and has no complaints. The bag has a zip lock to it, which is good, otherwise I have to fold the edges and use a large clip to close it and this is more airtight. I try to vary my dog's diet so he doesn't keep eating the same thing so this can just one of the variations. Overall, I have no complaints."}
