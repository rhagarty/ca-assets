So I stopped. The resuting reflux was horrendous.<br /><br />I started using 2 teaspoons of Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey 30 minutes before meals. I have not needed any type of antacid. I am careful though. I don't eat known irritants like coffee, tomatoes, and chile (green or red). I stay away from all gluten containing foods - or those that might have been cross-contaminated.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey, I have broadened the types of food I eat again. The taste is good and I have learned to like the 30 minutes I wait from \"taking\" the honey until I eat. I don't use antacid. This Manuka honey is much better than proton pump inhibitors."}
