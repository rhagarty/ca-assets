This is great for my hair and skin. I've made Ice pops for my kid sister,her friends, and myself and they taste great. I am afro Caribbean with wavy hair opposed to super kinky hair but my hair gets really dry if I leave it out(wash n set style). But this is great for those using protective styling and for the swimmers like myself. It keeps my hair moist and doesn't weigh it down and my skin look great as well. People don't realize that the chlorine in our shower/water systems here in the states is very drying on our hair and bodies. I'm just glad I got a product that 100% natural and from a vendor who I can trust. I've been ripped off by buying hair products at walmart and supply stores. I live in a predominantly white neighborhood and it is very hard finding things that work for my hair. So, I have to go to neighborhoods out of my way or shop online. And after finding out I bought conditioner that was mixed with bleach (clorox) from an online store that turned my hair into straw/ash it can be very frustrating. So I had to cut off my hair about 5 inches and I'm re-growing it. I had to file a claim with the business bureau and everything. But, thank god for reviews or I wouldn't know where to shop or who to trust these days."}
