Certainly, hasn't hurt, but not sure it has all the healing powers others claim, but only time will tell. A few things...this honey tastes great, just about like regular honey. So don't be afraid to order it thinking you can't handle the taste. It has the consistency of a honey butter spread and is great right out of the jar, or on toast. Bottom line, probably more expensive than regular honey, but if you have some digestive issues, worth trying, as it is a good tasting product."}
