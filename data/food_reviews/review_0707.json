Truth be told, he seems to prefer a much cheaper alternative to this brand (which also might even be healthier based on the nutritional listings).  This particular mix doesn't appear to be too \"beneful\" after all.  Per usual, corn seems to be the predominant ingredient.<br /><br />So while this may be a good value for the cash-strapped dog owner, I don't expect to be purchasing it anytime in the future."}
