It is sturdy, and even to this day they are super excited when the see it getting filled.<br /><br />The one thing I will say is the rope is awesome as long as it lasts, in this house that meant about 3 weeks. I don't think that is a problem with the toy--my guys have always destroyed rope toys ASAP.<br /><br />We replaced the rope with a small tennis ball inside the container that just blocks the hole, but bounces around with the food still making it  challenge to get the prize. similar to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MW8KLM\">Chuckit! Tennis Ball Small 2-inch, 2 pack</a><br /><br />There are scratches from lots of teeth, but no cracks and only one of our dogs has gotten the end off (he was a freak and could unscrew any container, open screen and regular doors gently with his mouth! *dane mix)"}
