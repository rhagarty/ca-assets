I'm wondering what else you'd buy without 5 minutes of research!<br /><br />What did you expect for under $20? This bag for a small dog would last about 2 months or longer so at $20 it's about $.30 a day! I probably eat about $4 - $10 a day of food and I don't consider myself fancy at all.<br /><br />I bought this food because I was on a tight budget this month. Dog likes it. No nasty side effects or wet poop yet. Cheaper than Eukannuba which seems to be making him fat. I try a few more but this eems to be agreeing with my dog at the moment. Just read the packaging before complaining or buying."}
