They do not have the texture of pasta, but I grew up in Japan often eating osoba with these type of noodles, so it was very familiar. They also taste good with marina sauce and cheese. However, my body is not fooled by them. Less than an hour after eating a package, I'm hungry again. I tried having two packages at once, and I still get hungry. So they're a nice treat, but not helpful in trying to control my calorie intake."}
