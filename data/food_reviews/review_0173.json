My dog is unable to get the treats out and when I tried to pull on the rope I coudln't get them out either.  I also tried to pull the rope when the bottle is upside down and still no treats. I tried several sizes of treats/food to see if perhaps that would help and still no treats.  The rope in the bottle is so thick that nothing seems to fall through the bottle neck.  Don't bother purchasing."}
