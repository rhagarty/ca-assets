This made me wary to buy them, but I decided to be adventurous and got them anyway. When I first cooked them, there was no fishy smell that I could detect. The only problem I found was the texture. It was like jello and rubber combined. Once I got used to the texture, they were ok, but did not absorb much of the sause they were cooked in. I do not plan on buying these again, but may consider trying one of their flavored noodles.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
