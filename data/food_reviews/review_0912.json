I use it for my hair, skin,and  lips (tastes good).  I haven't cooked  with it.... Yet! It melts into the palm of your hand, no need to put it in warm water. (you may need to it you live in a place that is very cold. I live in Calif)  It absorbs into your skin and hair without feeling greasy. I wash my hair and while it is wet I put the oil in it and comb it through. I have thick curly hair and it leaves it soft when it dries. The whole family can use it. Definitely putting it on auto-order! and it is so affordable!  I recommended this to all my friends and family on FB."}
