I think I got two for $10 or $12, free shipping if you sign up for prime, you can always cancel later.  I use this to make vegan butter, mix about 1/2 (or slightly less) with olive oil, put it in your fridge.  You can also add lecithin if you have it available.  I only use it in the winter months to keep warm, it's too rich for warmer weather."}
