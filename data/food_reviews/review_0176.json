Note that in the \"Medium/Large\" photos for this item the stopper appears to be an actual purple and white rope, but the item I received had the solid purple soft rubber \"rope\" that appears in the \"Small\" photos.  This design is completely unsuited for even moderately powerful chewers.  I never would have bought this item had the photographs been accurate."}
