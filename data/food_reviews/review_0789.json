I haven't tried it.","text":"So..since I haven't tried it I have to rely on my two labs to let me know what they think. They are 11 years old (brothers) and have always enjoyed Purina One. Now they are on the senior version and are doing well. Shiny coats and they both eat great.<br /><br />I have been told that dogs don't get tired of having the same food over and over, but decided to try out the Beneful (1 cup mixed in with 2 cups of Purina One) and see what would happen. They ate it all. Didn't seem to try to pick out certain pieces. Just all gone.<br /><br />Guess they like it."}
