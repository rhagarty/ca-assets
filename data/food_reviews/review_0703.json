My dogs, a Tibetan Terrier and TT mutt will eat this but not as willingly as other dry brands like Halo (my usual brand). It's good for a change in food to keep them interested in dry food and I keep it for an emergency as we live in earthquake country. For some dogs, I am sure they will scarf it up but I've spoiled my dogs a bit."}
