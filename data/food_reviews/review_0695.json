She doesn't like many brands of dog food, and turns down most offers of dog biscuits, etc.  But she eats the Beneful.  And that's good -- no dog food is healthy if the dog doesn't eat it.  She does eat certain shapes/flavors of bits first, but she eats them all.  They are smallish kibbles that would probably work for just about any size dog.<br /><br />But I wasn't thrilled to see that the main ingredient is corn.  I like that this food has both animal and vegetable ingredients, but would prefer to give Lexie more animal protein and less corn. (I consider corn a grain, not a vegetable, not something that dogs are designed to eat.)<br /><br />But given the price point, overall I think this is a reasonable choice.  3 stars from me, 5 stars from the dog = 4 stars."}
