It's so good in place (or mixed with) butter and/or olive oil.  I've even used this on orange roughy (and other white fish) and the taste is dreamy...and made a much loved meal even more loved.  --After that meal, my husband even said \"when this gets down to 1/3, we will reorder\"... he never says this about any \"oils\".  I don't stop with just fish... this oil gets used (either alone or mixed with other oils) with just about everything that needs oil.<br /><br />I've used this on my skin (and as oil treatment for hair) as well, and love it!  I have very sensitive and prone to dry skin, and this helps.  I'll definitely be using this in my skincare as well.<br /><br />It's a little more expensive than several other brands, but it is so worth it."}
