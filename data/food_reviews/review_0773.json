For us, Purina Beneful is a decent option. It's not optimal nutrition or high tech, but your dog will probably eat it and be just fine. Our dog is small (about 9 lbs) and has no trouble with the size of the kibble in this variety. And a bag this size lasts quite a while. Ideally we could all eat like kings, even dogs, but until then, this is a reasonable, practical solution to \"what to feed the dog?\""}
