We have two small Yorkies - and they love this dog food! They even like the larger size pieces in other Beneful varieties.<br /><br />Our older Yorkie (She is 7 pounds) will pick out and eat the soft red pieces first before eating the crunchy bits, but our other, smaller Yorkie (under 3 pounds), will eat all but the lighter colored pieces. We also frequently add the wet Beneful Stews (in small plastic containers with colored lids) to the leftover dry Beneful bits. They have a very nice variety of 'prepared meals' -- which almost look good enough for humans! Big chunks of meat and veggies, and are a really nice compliment to the dry foods.<br /><br />Other than the all natural, no-grain dog foods, which my dogs really don't like, this is one of the best commercial dog foods on the market."}
