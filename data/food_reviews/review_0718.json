I was already well into a few days of feeling bad so I gave this remedy a try. I'm not sure if it was the honey or because I had a mild case of the louses. But, my cold didn't last as long as it usually does. Plus, whenever I had a cough, it helped ease the cough much better than cough syrup.<br />Now that I'm over the nasty old cold, I still enjoy this honey. I found the taste much better than any other honey I've ever tasted. I also find it to be not near as sweet which makes it even more enjoyable. It goes great with toast or just a spoonful by itself. Therefore, I would recommend this product no matter what you use it for."}
