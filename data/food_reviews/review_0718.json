I can't tell if it has any of the health benefits it claims - my dog is healthy to start with - but he really likes it, and he's a picky eater. As soon as I brought it in the house, he was all over the shipping box. That's a big deal since he has not gotten excited about dog food since I switched to all dry. He seems to eat less to be satisfied, there's been no stomach upset, and his waste is more compact. That alone is a benefit since he weighs 80 pounds . . . I may switch to this permanently. I've got one more brand to try first."}
