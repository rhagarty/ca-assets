All you do is put 1/2 cup of oats in a little crockpot with 2 cups of boiling water before you go to bed, then an hour before I get up the crockpot starts on high on a timer so when I get out of the shower the oatmeal is ready to go.  Just mix in some blueberries, raisins, craisins, dates, nuts or whatever you want and eat."}
