It's all the same sized, crunchy bits of food and he liked it very much. He really chows down on this Beneful dog food though. It had different sized and different shaped pieces, some soft and some crunchy. However, I don't think he noticed the various textures at all. He's a big dog and eats a couple scoops a day. We didn't do a subtle switch by mixing more and more of the new food in with his old, we just started feeding him the new food in his usual portion. He did not have any dietary problems with the straight switch. Everything was normal.<br /><br />What I really like about this dog food is the packaging. With other dog foods, we have to tear apart the bag and poor the food into another container with a lid. Beneful has a Ziploc-type closure. I don't have to transfer the food and I can squeeze the extra air out of the bag as it empties so that the food will stay fresher. Beneful is a win-win; my dog and I both like it."}
