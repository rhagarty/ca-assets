I mix this with a little bit of turmuric for acne cleansing and toning mask and it works extremely well. It reduces the size of the inflammation/pimple and leaves skin soft and smooth.  Last week I went on a 30 mile bike trail and fell off my bike.  A few days later I noticed a nice blueish half dollar size bruise on my thigh.  On a whim, I decided to use the manuka honey on it overnight to see if it would help since I was already using it for skin.  Well to my amazement, the bruise was almost gone the very next day!  After 3 days of use, I could not see the bruise at all!  For me this is THE BEST natural product for my skin.  I have darker skin that actually doesn't even bruise easily but when it does, it takes months to fully heal.  Discoloration takes even longer to disappear so I am truly truly happy with the brand and product."}
