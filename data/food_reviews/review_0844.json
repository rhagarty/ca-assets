I'm sure most of you know, that steel cut oatmeal aren't rolled and boiled, so as a result, become slightly more nutritious than its rolled oat cousins.  Rolled oats are common in the instant oatmeals.  But enough of history.<br />Now, I didn't really know how much oatmeal this would yield, but one cup yields enough for 4 large servings.  As a 4-pack, I think this will probably last me a few months, easily.  Maybe the only pain is that it takes half an hour to make, but it's worth it.  The oats provide a nice bite and a slight crunch, but it's overall smooth.  Honey is always a good thing to add for quick flavor.  Fruits work just as well.  If you're feeling really adventurous, and have a brulee torch on hand, you can sprinkle the top with some sugar and proceed to brulee! And of course, you can add fruit before or after the brulee for a new dimension of flavor!<br />Bottom line, this will fill you up, and for quite a long time."}
