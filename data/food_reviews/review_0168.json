I'm committed to a low-carb lifestyle and find it easy most of the time. However, there was one carb I missed; Asian noodle dishes, like pad thai. I got the angel-hair sized noodles, and they look like rice noodles, and come packaged in a liquid filled bag. I was surprised by the weight of the shipping box. They are made from plant fiber so no calories, carbs, sugar, wheat, etc. Crazy impossible, right?<br />I used these in a chicken dish with a spicy sauce, and they were really enjoyable, not funky, and cured my Asian noodle craving. The consistency is very similar to \"al dente\" rice noodles in pad thai.<br />So if you are watching carbs, calorie, sugar, gluten, etc. and are looking for a pasta alternative, check them out."}
