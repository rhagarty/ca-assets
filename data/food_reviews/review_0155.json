I already knew to rinse in cold water and then boil for 5 min. before it arrived. It barely smelled when I opened it, and only when I stuck my nose to it was there a mild fishy smell. Gone by the time I rinsed the noodles. After boiling, I added to a can of Progresso Lite Vegetable soup for a minute or two. Tasted/felt very similar to ramen noodles, but from what I've read, this is a whole lot healthier. Just reordered; I hope to make this a diet staple. Also, I split this initial order with a friend because we were so concerned about the reviews. She also added it to Progresso Lite Soup and had similar opinion. This product is probably best for someone who already eats healthy. If you expect this to taste good with spaghetti sauce and replace your craving for pasta, you will be disappointed.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
