I mixed this with some banana cream pudding and it was heavenly. The coconut flavor and smell it gives is incredible. I also add 2 tblsp to my green tea with honey and it gives my tea that extra yum factor. Will be reordering this product and i am currently actively trying out new recipes for this. I bought 2-16 oz jars, but i can quickly see that will not be enough as i will be using it on skin and hair. This is the real deal, it is not the refined oil you find in grocery stores. Refined vs Unrefined, i'll go with unrefined."}
