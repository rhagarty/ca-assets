The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not \"ruin\" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again.","Description":"Heart Healthy"}
