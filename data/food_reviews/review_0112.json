Trying to eat healthy, but keep tastes and textures of my favorite high-cal/carb foods is tricky. I love that these noodles have a noodle like taste and texture, without the carbs or cals., or density, for that matter. also like the auto-shipment and discount. These noodles are close to two dollars at a local specialty grocer in my town and I can save when ordering them through amazon."}
