Nicely and safely packaged. Coconut oil came congealed. At warm temperature, it will liquidify.<br />Great for dry skin. Smells good too. Apply onto hair for silky smooth hair. I use it at night, leave it on, cover my pillow with a towel. Not sure about cooking, but I used as a salad dressing oil and it tasted yummy."}
