Sliced beef + Green Onion(could be just sliced Onion) + Tofu + Shirataki + Soy source + Sugar + Sake + raw egg as dip make simple Sukiyaki Dish! Shirataki will absorb seasonings and smells will be gone. It seems a bit expensive cuz it is not daily food like in Japan and made in USA. Japan has needle type and round type, also sweet jelly type. We might be able to make balsamic vinegar or Tomato taste Sukiyaki and I am to try it later! Also, Tokoroten/Kanten in Mitsumame is good in summer as snack, it is made from seaweed and 0 calorie. Enjoy!"}
