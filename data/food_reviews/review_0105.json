She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage.  One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit.  I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it.  Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet.<br />As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty..."}
