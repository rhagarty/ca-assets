I saw this in a store and was hesitant that she would 'get it', but after a few tries and showing her where the food came out she mastered it. When she's hungry she'll bring it to me and place it at my feet. It takes her a lot longer to eat and she's content and happy while doing it now. I've since bought her the round version of this because she's mastered Tug A Jug."}
