Paid almost $35 for 17.6oz bottle. First, I was skeptic until I used it. I occasionally suffer from GERD and took Nexium. I used Manuka Honey 3/4 teaspoon at bedtime and immediately all symptoms went away. I took 1 teaspoon for 3 days every time I felt like flu or cold symptoms and it worked every time. So, I was looking for ordering more. This Wedderspoon organic variety is not the same as original from NZ but it has almost same quality. Cost is almost same. Fast delivery.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
