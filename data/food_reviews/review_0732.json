As with cows and humans, corn is not exactly the most nutritious \"vegetable\" (actually it is a grain) for a diet. Eaten in moderation, it is fine, but as a primary source of carbon molecules and proteins, it is not the easiest food source for our or our dogs' bodies to process.<br /><br />In addition to the corn products, the second ingredient is a meat by-product - not exactly the best protein source we envision when hear words like beef or chicken or meat... or see a picture of sliced muscle meat on the packaging."}
