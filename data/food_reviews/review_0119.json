The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the \"game\" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the \"mouth\" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game \"reasonably\" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope."}
