We love using it for high temperature cooking (when olive oil and other oils are not appropriate to use) and also especially on our popcorn.  Coconut oil is so good for you and tastes delicious!  This product is wonderful too because it is organic, extra virgin, and very consistent in quality.<br /><br />We're really pleased with the pricing here at Amazon AND the customer care; when one container arrived to our house punctured and broken, Amazon immediately sent out a new container.<br /><br />We will definitely order Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil again."}
