I hate the instant stuff as I was home-grown on my grandmother's long-cooking rolled oats that she cooked on a kerosene-burning stove.<br /><br />When in Ireland many years ago, I had steel-cut oats on several occasions -- another amazing experience. Any time I've tried Irish Oats at restaurants here in the U.S., they've had a funny taste.  I suspect most kitchens use shortcuts.<br /><br />I was thrilled when I purchased these oats, cooked them with care, and tasted the results. Heavenly! No shortcuts to great oatmeal.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
