Completely natural & unrefined so this is the purest & best kind of coconut oil. I use it as an overnight treatment for my hair & started to notice improvements right away. Smells amazing! I take a chunk in my hand, rub my hands together so it liquifies & apply it to my hair. You get a huge container for a great price. You won't regret this purchase! On a side note if you don't like the smell of coconut, you won't like this product. It's pure coconut oil so of course it smells like coconut. It seems silly to write it but you wouldn't believe how many reviews I've seen where people actually complain that the coconut oil smells like coconut!","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
