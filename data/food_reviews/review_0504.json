There is definitely some coconut taste due to the fact that it's a virgin product but that doesn't bother me at all. The taste and texture are alot more pleasant than other brands of coconut oil I have used in the past. I usually use it when making scrambled eggs or other assorted foods on the skillet. I can sometimes detect a little sweetness but I like it, especially with something salty. I have also used this oil to make chocolate truffles and baked goods and it has always come through like a champ. I highly recommend this as a great oil for any culinary purpose and I will definitely buy it again."}
