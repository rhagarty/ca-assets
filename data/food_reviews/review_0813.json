The cans were poorly packed and were loose in the over-sized box with only inflatable air bags packing, therefore most of the 8 cans were dented. One can was bashed so badly that the rim became detached from the can, and some of the contents  spilled into the box.  While I love the oatmeal, I was very disappointed with the careless packing.  Items this heavy should be in a stronger box."}
