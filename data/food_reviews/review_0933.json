Organic, unrefined coconut oil can be expensive when purchased locally.  I started using this regularly for cooking and baking, and I'm very pleased with the results!  It's delicious on toast, waffles and pancakes, and perfect for stir-frying vegetables and meats, as it has a better heat tolerance than olive oil.  Also, I believe it's helped me with my cholesterol imbalance. I tested once at a low HDL (good) level.  After some research on the benefits of unrefined coconut oil on cholesterol, I gave it a try.  A recent blood test confirmed an increase to a healthy HDL level, as well as a low LDL (bad) level."}
