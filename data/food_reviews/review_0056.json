He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor."}
