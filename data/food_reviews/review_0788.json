I have had a couple of two-month bouts of excessive acid combined with gastritis (stomach lining inflammation) and tried it both times.  Both times I had to give up on it because all it seemed to do was increase the burning sensation in my esophagus and stomach, so I really can't recommend it for people with digestive problems.  Plus I personally find it far too sweet, although my husband doesn't.  On the other hand, I do keep a jar of this particular brand around because we have both found it soothing when we have sore throats due to colds.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
