The can is quite handy when empty for a variety of things.  We cook it for about twenty minutes which is a bit less time than recommended, but the crunchy feel is, to us, a better one than when cooked for a longer time.  Once you have this you will not be eathing much of the quick oats.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
