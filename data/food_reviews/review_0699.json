I just can't recommend a dog food that contains more corn than it does any other ingredient.  The second ingredient was a meat \"meal\" and the next few were other grains.  While I do realize that dogs need balance in their diet just as we do, this is NOT a balanced diet for them and doesn't come anywhere close to meeting their nutritional requirements.","Description":"Peanut Butter Crunch"}
