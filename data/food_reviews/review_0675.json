Normally she will only eat a little and then come back and do that on and off till the bowl is gone, with this dog food she stayed there and ate until the whole bowl was gone. It is an obvious favorite for her and we will be changing what food we purchase for her from here on out!","Description":"Peanut Butter Crunch"}
