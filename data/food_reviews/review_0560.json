And so far, this is the best I've tried. I actually started using coconut oil for my skin as I have suffered with very dry skin my entire life. It absorbs quickly and since I love the smell of coconut, it was perfect for me. But don't worry, if you don't love the smell of coconut, it fades pretty quickly. I then started using it as an oil treatment for my hair with fantastic results. Finally, I'm starting to incorporate into my cooking. Needless to say, I am very pleased and will just put this on auto ship!"}
