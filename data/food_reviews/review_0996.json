I leave it on for about an hour or at night when its washed out my hair feels a little dry but shiny. If you are protein sensitive i would not recommend using this but my hair loves protein so this is another products i will use for life. I don't use it on my scalp because my scalp starts to itch when its on my scalp so its only applied to the length on my hair."}
