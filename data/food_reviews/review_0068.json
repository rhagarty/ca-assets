I put her kibble in it and she immediately hauls it into her crate she she can get the food out without having to chase it around the house.  She is not a toy chewer, but this has cracked just from her dropping it a few inches.  I have glued it several times, but the last time was so bad that the glue has now made it so I can't screw the bottom on.  This has lasted 1 month with a very gently now 5 month old Newfoundland. Not a great track record, but she loves it so much that I will order another. Thank God for Amazon Prime where I can get another one quickly as she looks disappointed when I put her food in her dish rather than this device.","Description":"Shredded Wheat"}
