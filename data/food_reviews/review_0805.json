Oats are uniformly cut and cook up in only 25 minutes. I cook a cup at a time which lasts me most of a week. They store well in a plastic storage container in the refrigerator. I measure 4 cups of water and a tsp of salt in a 6 cup pan, add a dash of nutmeg and a handful of dried cranberries (craisins?). When the water reaches a rolling boil, I tun the heat down to low (#2 0n my range), and stir in a cup of the oats, set the timer to 25 minutes, come back when it goes off and store the cooked oats. A bowl of these oats with Sweet n Low and milk heated in the microwave will keep me satisfied for 5 -6 hours. Great fiber!!!"}
