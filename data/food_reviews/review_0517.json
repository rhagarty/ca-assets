The kind I was using was refined. She mentioned that I could get a way better deal on Amazon using Subscribe and Save. Since this is a regularly used item in our house, usually for stove top popcorn, I checked into it. She was right! We love the price and the extra flavor it adds to our homemade popcorn not to mention the lovely convenience of having it delivered to our front door for free. Thank you Amazon."}
