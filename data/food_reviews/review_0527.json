I'm always open to trying healthier alternatives to things, especially when they taste better too, and this stuff fits the bill! So far I've made fried eggs, pan fried french fries, stir fry, and cupcakes and they've all tasted amazing!! I can smell and taste a very subtle coconut smell/taste in the foods that I use it in and I thought the french fries would taste totally weird but they actually turned out super yummy. The fiance, however, says he doesn't notice any difference (I'm a super taster though, so I'm not sure which one of us is more accurate). I've replaced my vegetable oil completely with this stuff and now I can't get rid of my half bottle of useless vegetable oil..I think you can use this to replace butter in recipes as well but I haven't tried it like that yet. I plan on buying a book on the subject of coconut oil and its health benefits so I can find out more about it. I'm going to buy the next size bigger of this next time since my first tub is already almost gone, I'm definitely hooked for life!"}
