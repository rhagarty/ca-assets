It has superior mouth feels to it...and It has such a great natural flavor that you don't really need milk....just a little cinnamon or a little fresh fruit....and I use a artificial sweetner with mine.<br /><br />I don't believe that you can have a better bowl of oatmeal than this Mccanns...and I've tried several---so especially for those of you --trying to return to more healthful eating--I highly suggest that you give this a try !!!<br /><br />It just tastes great!<br /><br />It is packaged in a can --so it stays fresh and airtight. I have bought it several times...and have never had any issue with delivery or condition at arrival.<br /><br />Much better price than the supermarket !!"}
