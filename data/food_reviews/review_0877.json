I have always shivered at the thought of cooked oatmeal because I just find cooked Quaker oats to be nauseating (love them in cookies, but not cooked by themselves).  My parents eat oatmeal all of the time, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of it.  However, this stuff was part of a promotion, and people wrote that it doesn't taste like Quaker, so I gave it a shot.  I'm so glad that I did, because they are right!  This stuff is fantastic.  To me, it's texture and taste are soooo much better than what I've had in the past.  Like the reviewer before me, I added some agave nectar and really liked the combination.<br /><br />All four of my tins arrived crushed, and I mean crushed.  However, Amazon very promptly filled another order of them for me as a replacement.  Another example of excellent service by Amazon!"}
