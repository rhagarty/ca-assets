I use it three ways. First I use it as a daily skin moisturizer. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day without a heavy oily feel. I also use it as part of my hair regimen. I mix it with shea butter and jojoba oil to moisturize my natural locs. Finally, it is food grade. I use it as a spread on toast instead of butter and jams. It has a light sweet taste. Overall, I love this product and it is of high quality."}
