After the first few batches, he declared the coconut flavor in the popcorn was too noticeable, and bought another type of oil. I'm enjoying using the remaining coconut oil for everyday cooking (hubby won't eat cooked veggies, so I make them for myself), and am considering trying some as a moisturizer."}
