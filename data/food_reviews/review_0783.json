I am pleased that the pickier dog of the pair gobbles his bowl right up.  To be perfectly honest I have been most concerned with dog food price after rescuing these dogs.  I have had to contend with the initial costs of fencing and vet bills as one dog had a broken foot.  Since these are my first dogs I have had a bit of a learning curve and now I am trying to research dog food brands.  This brand does not have as much protein as others on the market but it does have corn.  I did not realize when I first started purchasing dog food how much \"filler\" is used and corn seems to fall into this category.  So, even though I love the convenience of being able to have it delivered to my door and my dogs like it I would like to find a more nutritious option."}
