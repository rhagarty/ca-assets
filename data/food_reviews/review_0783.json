But, I was desperate and so I tried it.  Here is what happened:<br /><br />I had acid reflux for two weeks straight, and it was progressively getting worse.<br /><br />After taking this for one weekend my heartburn has completely vanished.  I'm also not forced to take the honey every day, but if I ever have a flare up I just take some and 20 minutes later it is gone.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
