It arrived fairly quickly, but had leaked a bit inside it's box (I suppose that's to be expected with trying to ship an oil in the middle of summer).  I've had it for a month or so and it's only just starting to solidify in the cupboard.<br /><br />The oil smells wonderful, a yummy coconut smell, and when it's heated in a pan it just smells that much better. I use it every time I pan fry anything (eggs, fish, chicken, etc) and it always works wonderfully.  I haven't noticed it adding any coconut flavor to anything really, except perhaps eggs which I don't mind at all.<br /><br />I have used it in baking a couple of times and have had only one issue.  Because it's a 'solid' oil (depending on temperature) when I added cold eggs to the oil and didn't mix fast enough it started to chunk up so things didn't mix very smoothly.<br /><br />I should also add that my son has exzema and has since he was born.  I haven't found anything better then coconut oil to use as an after bath moisturizer for him, and he smells sooooo good when we are done.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
