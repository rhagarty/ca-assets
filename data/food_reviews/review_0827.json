Very glad I did. It's delicious. Much better then conventional oatmeal. Different tasting but very good and hearty. I cook it the night before ( because it takes awhile to cook - and one cup makes alot!)while it's hot-  add some cinnamon, a little brown sugar and put it in the frig. In the morning, I add milk to the cold oatmeal and microwave for 11/2 or 2 min.. Try it, you may like it! Will replace my stock when it's gone."}
