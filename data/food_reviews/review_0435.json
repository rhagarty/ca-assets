I make between 1 and 3 of these each day so I use this oil very fast.<br /><br />I also use it with a little raw milk and raw honey to make one of the creamiest, tastiest cups of coffee you can imagine!<br /><br />The above smoothie can be turned in to a banana smoothie by adding half a banana and subtracting the eggs and honey.<br /><br />Can also be used externally in hair and on skin.<br /><br />This coconut oil should be a staple source of raw fat for every family, especially if you don't have ready access to fresh coconut!"}
