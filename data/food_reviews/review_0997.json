My husband bought it for me and I have used it as a deep moisturizer about twice a week.  I can't describe the soul-satisfying scent or the elegant feel of rubbing this into my skin at night!  It's like eating an ice cream sundae without a single calorie...and the jar has lasted me almost 10 months! I highly recommend this coconut oil."}
