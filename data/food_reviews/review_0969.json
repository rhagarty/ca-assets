I read it was really good.  I thought I would give it a try when I bought a Whirley Pop.  This is so very good with making popcorn ... I add a little bit of butter too.  I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how good this taste.  I even eat small amounts right out of the jar.  I must say, not all coconut oil is the same.  I ran out so I bought more coconut oil at a local grocery store.  It is not the same, I am so disappointed.  The aroma isn't there.  I should have never wasted my money, and just came here to order more."}
