Unlike most products which have a plastic or paper container, McCann's still comes in an easy to open tin which a person can use for many things after the oats are long gone.  The oatmeal is not for a person in a hurry as you need almost 30 minutes to prepare.  But the cooked oatmeal is well worth waiting for.  Unlike rolled oatmeal which to me makes a mushy product which I won't eat, steel cut oats actually retain some of their shape after being cooked.  Since I've started eating oatmeal regularly, my total cholesterol has dropped 20 points!  McCann's steel cut oatmeal have a long shelf life, so I'm not afraid of buying a 4-pack or even two 4-packs when they are on special.  I've seen one can go for over $6 in some special food markets.  Enjoy!"}
