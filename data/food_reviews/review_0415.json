It's great on my skin.  I do a head-to-toe with it nightly and it keeps my skin all creamy-soft.  It has a nice sweet smell and stays solid at room temperature.  I'm turning thirty and hopefully it'll keep my face totally free of crows feet for a good long time to come.  No expensive anti-wrinkle creams here.  Also, it's fantastic for cooking Thai and Indian food.  Really high heat tolerance.  Takes forever to go rancid, so the shelf life is awesome.  It also clears up the allergic skin rash I get when I use latex gloves.  That stuff makes my knuckles crack and bleed, and the coconut oil is incredibly soothing.  This stuff is a great deal!"}
