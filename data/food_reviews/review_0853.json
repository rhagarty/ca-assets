Harding \"gimme salt and pepper popchips\"","HelpfulnessNumerator":1,"HelpfulnessDenominator":1,"Score":4,"Time":"1245456000","Summary":"Great product, too bad I wasn't sent the correct kind.","text":"These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!<br /><br />I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as \"Original\"... and lo and behold, I received \"Sea Salt and Vinegar\", not \"Original\".<br /><br />Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e-mail or something to tell me they ran out of \"Original\". I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble)."}
