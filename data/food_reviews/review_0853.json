It's taste, texture are far superior to any brand I've ever had. It's hardy, nutritious, versatile every day.  For Sunday breakfast hard to beat, I recommend starting off with a steaming bowl with your choice of flavorings (if desired, it's good by itself)--you can add some brown sugar, maple flavoring, blueberries, chopped apple, apricots, cranberries, banana or whatever (it's good with everything).  Serve it with orange, apple, grape, cranberry or some juice and coffee or tea.  Follow with English muffins, bagels or toast, favorite type of eggs, sausage or bacon and fresh fruit, and I'll guarantee, you'll swear you'll have a gourmet meal. I order it by the case regularly.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
