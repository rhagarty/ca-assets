I made chocolate chip cookies using it - and used my exact recipe but swapped coconut oil for butter. The cookies looked a little different than usual, but had a delicious crispy exterior and chewy interior. In fact, my kids preferred them.<br /><br />I also tried making brownies w/ them. I melted the coconut oil w/ my 63% chocolate over a double boiler and it looked more liquidy than when i do butter + chocolate. But i proceeded w/ the recipe and honestly, the brownies were delicious and i wouldn't have known the difference.<br /><br />I have been using it instead of canola oil for my eggs in the morning -- again, great results.<br /><br />I think it's an excellent cooking and baking fat and ordering it from amazon is very convenient. I highly recommend it."}
