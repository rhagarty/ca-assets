Cause i got the BIG sampler pack. Once i recieved them i opened the package and the smell is pretty strong fishy smell but not that bad. I cooked them exactly how it said to and they came out perfect. No smell or funny textures. I was worried i wouldnt be able to make them right but its pretty simple. We were doing the HCG diet and it got very boreing eating the same thing everyday and this added so many more options that we could do with the allotted food!"}
