There is a light coconut scent.  I use it mostly for my scalp and hair because I have dry scalp and alopecia areata.  I dig out a very small amount...about a teaspoon.  I let it melt on my fingers, rub my fingers together, and then I just massage it into my scalp.  I do this at night, and wash it off in the morning.  It makes my hair feel soft.  I like to add a drop of lemon oil, lavender, primrose and/or rosemary and massage it in with the coconut oil.  It's a great all-natural stress reliever.  I have yet to use the coconut oil in cooking, but my mom says that when she was younger she used to use it for cooking (as well as her hair).  I sometimes use it for moisturizing my skin (everything but face), but it's important to rub it in very well since this is pretty greasy.  I will continue to buy this product!"}
