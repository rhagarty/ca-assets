They aren't like regular noodles, but if you're a pasta fan and you are trying to cut back drastically on calories-this noodle is for you.<br /><br />Don't get apprehensive of the taste in relation to the smell of the packaging water.  Make sure you rinse them very well.  They are GREAT with spaghetti sauce and go very well with sauteed vegetables and any other seasonings you'd like to add.  These noodles absorb much flavor (if dried properly) and really fill you up<br /><br />And they are calorie-FREE.  I still don't know how that's possible, but they really help me out when I'm needing a snack but close to my calorie count for the day!"}
