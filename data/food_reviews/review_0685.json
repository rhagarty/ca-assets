Whenever I try new dog food I risk having my dogs sick all over the floor. I have been feeding them food from the vet, but it just costs so much and we couldn't afford to keep buying food from the vet so I had to try something new. Enter, Purina Beneful Original Dog Food. I opened the bag and was immediately pleased with the zipper seal opening and that the food didn't have any strange smell. I gave it to my dogs and stood back, wondering if they would like it, and fearful of what was to come later once they digested it! They immediately got to eat and LOVED it! I still wasn't convinced because I didn't know if we would pay later with stinky gas or upset stomachs. I am happy to say that this didn't bother their stomach one bit! Their poops were solid, they had no gas and got excited every time they say the bag of food. One day the bag of food was on the counter and one of my dogs tried to jump up to get it, he loves it so much! I am so happy to have found Purina Beneful because not only are my dogs happy with the taste, I don't have to suffer from the side effects of bad dog food on their stomach!"}
