Cooked according to directions, it has a chewy texture, nutty flavor, and is satisfying.  I prefer it without extra sweetener.  My microwave simmer cycle brings liquid to a boil and then reduces power to simmer for time set.  Using the microwave, I don't worry about scorching or burning. Use a large bowl to allow for oatmeal and water to come to a boil but not spill over.  If it boils over, it is a mess.  I prepare it first thing in the morning and ready to eat in 20-30 minutes. Amazon price has been competitive.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
