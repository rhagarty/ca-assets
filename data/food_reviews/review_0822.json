Now the directions say to make it with four cups water and one cup of the dry oatmeal. But I make it with two cups of water, two cups of milk, and one cup of oatmeal. That adds to the creaminess.<br /><br />Also, here is a wonderful tip I learned from my many times of cooking the oatmeal. This stuff takes about thirty minutes to cook normally (because it has to simmer for a while). What I do is cook it the night before. I boil the milk/water, add the oatmeal, stir it in, put the cover on, then put it in my fridge (without cooking for 30 minutes). In the morning you then take that pot and basically just slowly warm it up to a boil and presto! lovely, creamy steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. BTW, that is enough oatmeal for two people."}
