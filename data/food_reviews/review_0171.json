He would bore easily of eating out of his dish, and we found that he was eating below his recommended daily intake.  He was just getting bored and distracted.  We ordered the tug-a-jug and began giving him all his meals in it--it's made all the difference!  He makes sure to get our attention while he's maneuvering it to get at the food, he seems very proud of his accomplishment whenever he gets the pieces to come out.  He gets very creative with different tactics.<br /><br />Five stars across the board, the tug-a-jug has become absolutely indespensable to us!"}
