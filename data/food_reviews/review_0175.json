At first they nosed it and tossed it, but within 5 minutes my black lab had ripped the rubber stopper in half and dumped out the kibble! Maybe he is smarter than I thought!<br />The toy is completely unusable now and we are sedning it back.<br />I think this would be a great toy for a smaller or less voracious chewer. If your dog is a strong chewer, I would get something else to entertain them."}
