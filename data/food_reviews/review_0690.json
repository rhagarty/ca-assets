Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product, corn gluten, wheat flour are the four main ingredients.  Sugar is also one of the ingredients and that explains why the flies came right to this food as soon as I poured it into my dogs' food bucket.  As a fly attractant this product works as great as Bud Light beer.<br /><br />My dogs don't even care for it.  I poured some of this \"Beneful\" next to their Taste of the Wild Lamb kibble and they seem to prefer the Lamb kibble over their corn junk food.  My dogs just aren't used to eating junk food.<br /><br />And to top it all off, during my daily back yard scoop poop ordeal, I had to remove more than usual piles of soft, yellow turds.  This food is clearly not good for dogs.<br /><br />I don't even know why this is called \"Beneful.\"  Beneful to whom?  Purina, perhaps?<br /><br />See my photograph under \"customer images.\""}
