I have an old 3 cup \"fuzzy logic\" type Rice Cooker, and using \"Porridge\" mode works best.  A word of warning, do not rinse the oats, just pour in the water, set for porridge, press start, and walk away!  I am used to rinsing rice and did that with the oats, and it was really dry, not at all oatmeal.<br />If your rice cooker has a timer, you can set it up the night before too.<br /><br />Using a rice cooker makes cooking steel cut oats more convenient than cooking instant oatmeal on the stove.  It is pretty slow though, but if you are used to rice cooking times, you'll be fine.  Just don't expect it to be done in 5 minutes or less.<br /><br />And McCann's Steel Cut Oats in general?  I haven't had a chance to compare it to other brands, but I really like the tin cans.  Very strong and thick.  But I don't really like the thick foil seal, cutting it leaves a rather sharp and ragged edge.<br />Of the many cans of McCanns Steel Cut Oats, they have excellent quality control, same great taste each time.<br /><br />-Ed","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
