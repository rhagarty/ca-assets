Price","HelpfulnessNumerator":1,"HelpfulnessDenominator":1,"Score":5,"Time":"1323648000","Summary":"Awesome stuff!","text":"Bought it primarily to use for diaper rash ointment. It does a fantastic job of keeping nasty rashes away, and it cleared up the one my son already had (and it's cloth diaper friendly! triple win!). I've also used it as a leave-in conditioner and my hair was soft and shiny. It also makes for a good cooking oil (not from the diaper rash tub!), and the scent and taste isn't too heavy. Wish I knew about it before!"}
