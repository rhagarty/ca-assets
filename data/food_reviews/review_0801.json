However, it was pure torture to eat it.<br /><br />I was staying with my family at a Residence Inn last week and thought that I would give oatmeal a try from their continental breakfast bar.<br /><br />While the oatmeal did not have an objectionable taste (being nice), it was all sticky and gooey which was not too nice!<br /><br />Wanting the health benefits of oatmeal, I decided to give this product a try after reading the reviews.<br /><br />First of all, this is a more coarse cut of oatmeal, which I would not classify as \"meal\" at all. It is more like a boiled grain with a bit of  chewy consistency. There is nothing sticky or gooey about this at all.<br /><br />For me, the fact that I am eating oatmeal (should be called oat\"grain\"), is nothing short of a minor miracle. It is pleasant and tasty. What a pleasant surprise!!!!<br /><br />I hope that you will give it a try.<br /><br />Blessings ad good health to you and your family!"}
