The second is picky and refuses to eat the same food over an extended period.  At our vet's suggestion, for the picky one, we started using mix ins.  This can be just a little something left over from dinner, broth, or a small amount of a different dog food.  The Beneful made a great mix in, and of course I give the mix in to both of them.  They both enjoy it and picky eater has been gobbling us his regular highly nutritious food along with a bit of Beneful tossed in.<br /><br />I've not used Beneful as their main food, and doubt I will. But did want to add a plus for the mix in option for those with picky eaters."}
