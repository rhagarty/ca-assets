I had/have a nasty wound on the inside of my left foot that was about 8\" long and nothing was helping it heal very fast.  Since I have been putting this Manuka honey on my foot every 12 hrs. and covering it with a nonstick pad each time, it has started healing fast and is now a little less than 2\" in 6 weeks.  I also take a teaspoon twice a day internally.  I have told everyone what I am doing, including the Dr., and he told me to keep it up because it was unbelievable how quickly it was healing.  Some members of my family have ordered 2 jars each and are also using it.  I will never be without it as long as I can afford it.  It has gone up $3 per jar in less than two months since I have been ordering.  May have to check out other sources.<br /><br />I also know that local unprocessed honey is very good for anyone and can be used in the same way.  But I think the Manuka honey has some properties in it that the local honey doesn't have.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
