Sadly for them, they'd already had dinner and had to wait until the next morning to taste the goods. But when those colorful nuggets of kibble spilled into their respective dog dishes, they were in doggie heaven, snarfing down the food like they hadn't been fed in ages. My little foodies loved the original flavor of Beneful. One minor issue--it makes my bigger guy a bit gassier than usual. Oh, well."}
