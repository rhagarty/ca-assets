Only the Chiweenie can get the food out of this toy---which is a good thing really because he is the only one with a weight problem.  He is also the youngest and the one most likely to get into trouble when left at home alone.  He drags this toy around by the hard rubber ball part, then lays it flat on the floor, pushing and pulling the rubber rope until he empties it.  The other dogs just watch, but never attempt it themselves.  It is easy to refill except I struggle sometimes with lining up the grooves on the screw-on lid.  It washes well in the dishwasher.  I recommend this toy for every dog, but many dogs will need a little occupational therapy to learn how to use it."}
