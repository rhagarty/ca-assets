Today, I tried them and they were wonderful! I rinsed them in a calender with warm water. Then I mixed them with a homemade low cal spaghetti sauce,then heated in the microwave. Very nice and filling. I will buy again to help me drop some calories,plus pounds! They smelled and tasted just like the sauce.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
