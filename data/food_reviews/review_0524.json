I use this in a variety of my RAW dessert recipes, from cookies to pies to chocolate sauces and the like. Adding a tablespoon or two will give you that nice coconut flavor without taking away from the rest of what you have going on in the recipe. Great buy for the price!","Description":"Multigrain Crunch"}
