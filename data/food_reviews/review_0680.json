The last brand of dog food resulted in the latter. Purinal beneful: The former. He seems to really like it. The bowl gets emptied quickly.<br /><br />I have a Chihuahua so it is important that the kibbles be manageable size. He has absolutely no problem with these kibbles and isn't picky about which one he gets although he does seem to eat the green ones first.<br /><br />And finally, storage is always a problem. Our dog (5 pounds) will take forever to go through a bag like this. So the built-in ziplock on the bag top makes it so that we no longer have to transfer our dog food out of the container and into a plastic sealable tub.<br /><br />After reading the other reviewers concerns about the ingredients and comparing the ingredients to some higher end brands, this does seem to be inferior (a lot heavier on fillers) to the more expensive brands but in line with the others of this price range. We generally pick the best bargain among dog foods. If you are looking for the best nutrition regardless of price, you may want to look elsewhere.","Description":"Peanut Butter Crunch"}
