Subsequently I bought another can from a local party store and it tasted stale and bitter. Needless to say that I tossed it into the trash. Later I went online and found it on Amazon marketplace from DAB Nutrition and ordered a pack of four.<br /><br />I never liked rolled oats but once I discovered the steel cut oats I got hooked. I cook mine in my Zojirushi Induction Rice Cooker <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAIW1C\">Zojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer with Induction Heating System, Stainless Steel</a>. I use 4 parts water to I part Oat plus a drop of Extra virgin Olive Oil to avoid sticky residue on the cover. Alternatively I use 2 parts \"Original Rice Dream\" plus 2 parts water to 1 part Oat. Substitute the word \"part\" with the word \"Cup\". I put the mixture in the Rice Cooker and select the Porridge cycle and in 1 hr 7 Mins the cooker would play a beautiful melody to signify that breakfast is ready. You can use the timer setting on the cooker too but it may have a little 'leftover' or 'overcooked' grain taste to it in the morning. This is why I do not like the taste of the so-called \"GABA Brown Rice\". But if you have to leave for work early morning then timer cooking may be a way to go. If you like your oats thick then use 3 parts water to 1 part Oat. Once the Oat is done what you put into it depends on how health conscious you are as well as the limit of your imagination.  Toss in a few dried dates or cherries, how about a spoonful of wheat germ or flax seed? Be creative and your body would thank you for it. I do not cook my oats on stove or in the micro wave. Always buy fresh Oats."}
