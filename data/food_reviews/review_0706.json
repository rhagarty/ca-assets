They tend to have bad food allergies, and this food has kept them relatively allergy-free (so it is a nice alternative to the very expensive specialty foods that are out there).  Overall the ingredients and quality of the food seems to be great, the animals are happy, and so I declare the food a winner.  Recommended!"}
