I first had it at a four star hotel while on vacation.  I think this brand is far better than the Quaker Oats Steel Cut version and Bob's.<br /><br />A great way to make it, adapted from Cook's Illustrated:<br /><br />1.  Melt one tablespoon of butter in a pan and add one DRY cup of oatmeal.<br />2.  Then add it to two  cups of water and one cup of milk that have been simmering.<br />3.  Towards the end of cooking, around 30 minutes in, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt.<br />4.  Cook for about 45 minutes.  Add additional water or milk if needed and serve.<br />5.  I usually double the recipe when i'm cooking for the family."}
