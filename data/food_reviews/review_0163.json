He still hasn't learned exactly how the treats are dispensed, which is nice because I don't have to constantly refill the toy.  Tug-a-jug does not keep Weezer occupied for long stretches of time, but it entertains him for 15-30 minutes here or there.  It has held up fairly well, with just a few scratches on the plastic sides.  I put Cheerios into the tug-a-jug as a treats."}
