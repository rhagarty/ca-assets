There are just so many health benefits to using coconut oil, so its the no brainer oil of choice for cooking. Before finding Nutiva brand, which is a great value, I used several others brands - but Nutiva tasted the best and was the best value. Nutiva has an incredible flavor, and yes, it does taste like coconut.. which is a good sign that the oil is a good quality and not de-odorized with chemicals. If you're on the face, just order this and you'll never look back."}
