My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat, hand pressing the liquids, then boil the water out. This oil tastes and smells just like the kind my Mother used to spend hours making.  This is definitely worth the price for the amount of oil that you get. I use this as a hair detangler out of the shower, as make-up remover, face and body moisturizer, and lip balm. I also use it for cooking and as a dietary supplement."}
