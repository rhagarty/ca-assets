Overall it's a good quality and the dogs seem to like it fine. They're not terribly excited about it though. They look at it and almost say \"well, OK if that's all you got\". We have three, Australian Shepherd, Jack Russell, and a mini schnauzer. We also have a neighbor dog, Lab mix, that comes over to eat whenever possible. Since there's enough competition (think, if you're not going to eat that, then I will or I'll eat it just so you can't have it) there are rarely leftovers. Sometimes there are leftovers and like I said it rarely happens, but does more often with this brand. Decent feed, but there is better out there."}
