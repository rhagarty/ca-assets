For years I had problems with every single cold evolving into a nasty sinusitis infection.  Now at the first sign of a cold and/or sore throat I start drinking white tea with this honey in it, many times a day.  If I have a sore throat I will take teaspoons of this by itself.  My colds are healing faster, my throat feels better faster, and I am not having sinusitis after colds anymore. I am also doing other things like sinus rinses, but I have always done that.  This honey seems to have added a significant benefit to my health.  It does cost a fortune but I just ordered another bottle and will continue to use it.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
