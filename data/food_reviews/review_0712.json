But she seems to have no problem with Beneful and has been eating it as her main dog food for years.  She is an older dog, but she seems to be maintaining health and energy on this food and continually devours her food. I feel good, as this seems to be a relatively healthy choice at a decent price.  But Emmy is probably the best judge as I have not gathered the courage to try it, and she seems to love it."}
