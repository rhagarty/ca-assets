We got it for him when he was 6 months old, and at 1 year, it is still one of his favorite toys!  I was afraid it may be too big for him to work since we got the medium-large sized jug and he only weighs 18 lbs., but it seems perfect for him now.  It took him a couple of days to figure out how to stand it up, and tip it over to get the treats into the neck of the bottle, and then pull on the rope until a treat comes out.  It works great with his small sized Newman's Own Organics Peanut Butter Dog Treats, and is easy enough to fill.  We only fill it about 1/2 full once every 1-2 weeks, and it keeps him self-entertained intermittently for hours.  The plastic is durable, and after 6 months of use, is still in great condition working great!"}
