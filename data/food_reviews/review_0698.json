I suspect Nutro is a lot better.  But my dog does eat this.<br /><br />Actually, she eats about half of it, picking out the kibbles that she finds tasty.  She leaves one kind of kibble, so we probably throw out 15% of the bag.<br /><br />My dog sheds terribly if she eats some dog foods, but not this one.  No allergic or skin reaction.<br /><br />So, overall, I think its a good product."}
