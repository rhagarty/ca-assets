It has a very pleasant light coconut smell. In cooking I have never noticed a transfer of any coconut flavor to the foods I cook, which is a good thing. Basically you can use it to pan fry various food items without worrying about flavor conflicts.<br /><br />It works nicely as a skin moisturizer too. It's a little greasy (it's oil), but absorbs well, and again smells good (unless you don't like coconut).<br /><br />Tried it as a hair conditioner but that didn't work out too well. It is very easy to apply too much and end up with hair that looks like it has to be washed again. Maybe it takes practice. :)"}
