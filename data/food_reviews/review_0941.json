It is good coconut oil but not to strong. I use it on my skin, hair and had a teaspoon or 2 in my cocoa tea and it works well in all. I am not certain about the usage on my face though - my skin started feeling a bit dry after a few applications at night. So I am still looking into that. All in all it is a good product for a good price!"}
