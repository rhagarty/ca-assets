Ropes do not show on x-rays and ultra sound.  The dog was vomiting up to 15 times a day.  Day 3 - our dog could not walk any more. Luckily our vet convinced us to do exploratory surgery and found the rope knot in our dog's intestines.  It is a very hard knot that will tear the intestines.  If not for this surgery, our dog would had died from the obstruction."}
