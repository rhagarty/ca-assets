However, you can see how much they love this stuff! For my Water Spaniel (the brown dog) I slowly introduced Beneful into her diet, but even with a careful transition, it upset her tummy. And that means messy clean-up, if you know what I mean, lol! So, I'd recommend this food for a dog that simply won't eat other foods, as clearly they have the taste down pat, but in my opinion, there are better foods out there. If I myself try to stay away from GMOs, so should my dog."}
