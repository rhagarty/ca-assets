We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug-a-Jug.  At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it.  Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast.  Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version, but I find it cleans up easier and does not become frayed."}
