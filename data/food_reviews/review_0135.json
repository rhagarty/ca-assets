I rinse then dry the crap out of them on paper towels.  I then fry them with cooking spray to dry them out some more, serve with sauce when the family is having spaghetti.  I have also tried the rice which is good as well,  cook the same way except add whatever other flavorings I would add to rice.  A lifesaver for dieting!"}
