This is not what dogs were meant to eat, and I ordered this through Vine before reading the ingredient list. I like to have backup dog food in case we run out, and suprisingly my dog loved this.<br /><br />Many people say you shouldn't switch a dog's food quickly because their stomach won't adjust. I tend to feed my dog a combniation of a raw diet (raw meat, chicken, vegetables) and all natural dog foods from bags or cans.<br /><br />I did notice that my dog tended to have very runny poop after eating this, so I've stopped giving it to her more than one meal per week, and use it as emergency backup only.<br /><br />Dogs, like people, were meant to eat real food, mainly plants and meat...not this stuff. I gave it 3 stars because she liked it and ate it in its entirety, and I think it's like most conventional dog food available."}
