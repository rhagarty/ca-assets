It's nothing like that slimy instant stuff or lumpy rolled oats gruel.<br /><br />To avoid busy breakfast rush, prepare the night before by bringing water to simmer and adding oats, then cover and let sit overnight. This nutty, slightly chewy yummy oatmeal porridge will be ready the next morning. Add any or several of the following to add to your delight:  dried cherries or cranberries, bananas, chopped pecans or walnuts, molasses or brown sugar or honey, some cinnamon (helps avoid a quick morning blood sugar spike), warm nonfat/lowfat milk, or 1/2 and 1/2 if self-indulgent! This blend will keep those mid morning growlies away and you'll know you have fed your tummy as well as your heart! Mmmm good!","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
