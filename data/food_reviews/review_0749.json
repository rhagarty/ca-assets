People are fooled into buying this because of the commercials and packaging. These types of foods do not give dogs the protein they need. It gives them awful gas because they cannot digest the corn meal. There are much better food for dogs like Natural Balance and Merrick's Before Grain. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Learn to read ingredient labels before you buy."}
