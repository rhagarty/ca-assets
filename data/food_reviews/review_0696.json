They are so picky. But we had the chance to try Beneful for free, so why not? Without a backwards glance (which they usually do when we give them a dog food that is not the norm) they ate this right up.<br /><br />Of course, I cannot say if it tastes good. Or if it really IS more healthful to the dogs than the cheap brands. All I can honestly say is that my dogs like it, and they don't like many of dog foods. It's also nice that all the major stores in our area carry the brand, but with Prime, I just order it from Amazon and have it delivered. Hey, maybe that will make my dogs actually LIKE the mailman!!"}
