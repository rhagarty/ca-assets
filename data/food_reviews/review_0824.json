Absolutely delicious. I cook my oatmeal according to the direction, listed on the can,<br /><br />4 cups of water, bring to a boil and 1 cup of oatmeal. When I added the oatmeal to the boiling water, I stir, let it get a little thick, than I place a lid on the pot of oatmeal to steam it a little. It has to cook for 30 min. Its has a wonderful chewy texture, it does not taste anything like the oatmeal in the supermarkets, soo good. I eat this oatmeal ever morning for my breakfast.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
