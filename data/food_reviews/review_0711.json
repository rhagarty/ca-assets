If you're using Manuka honey to treat various gastrointestinal troubles (we use it any time we suspect food poisoning, intestinal virus, heartburn, reflux, ulcer, etc.... and there is NOTHING better!) then why would you use anything other than organic? Seriously. Any time your stomach just doesn't feel right, dip a teaspoon (a regular silverware-type, not a measuring teaspoon) half way into your honey (no need to \"scoop\", just dip), and eat it. You will feel relief so quickly you will NEVER reach for a Rolaid again. This has worked wonderfully on all 3 of my children as well.<br /><br />I only buy my Wedder's from Amazon, (not Marketplace) and I take advantage of the Super Saving Shipping. (Late in the season it can be hard to find, so I've learned to stock up for the year.) Remember: New Zealand seasons are the opposite of ours, and honey is not harvested in the winter/spring). So if you live in the US, and you're using Manuka honey, it may get a little tough to find during our summer/fall, since that is the New Zealand winter/spring.<br /><br />I have NEVER had any trouble with the way the honey's been shipped. It's always been taped, bubble packed, etc., and never has any of it shown any signs of leakage. Even so, buying from Amazon, the possibility of leakage has never been a worry, because in my experience, Amazon stands behind what it sells. Who else does that?  :o)"}
