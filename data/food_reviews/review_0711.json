We've switched from Pedigree.","text":"My dogs absolutely loved Beneful.<br />The first day I mixed it with their normal dog food (Pedigree).  They promptly fished through their bowls and ate the Beneful first.  I figured it was just because it was new.  Nearly two weeks later they are still sorting their food.  Now the mix is about 80% Beneful and 20% Pedigree. They leave the Pedigree on the floor next to the bowl.<br />I haven't noticed and I'll effects-no excess gas, no digestive issues, no burnt grass that we tend to get with other brands (Iams)."}
