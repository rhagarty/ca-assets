I usually use Purina One but got a bag of this to try out and am mixing the two together with great results.  Max loves the flavor and believe me she's picky.  The little crunchy veggies are the first things she eats and then on to the other food.<br /><br />It does have a crude fat ratio that I would like to lower but since Max likes this and the Vet says it's okay considering she only gets 1/3 of a cup twice a day I'm not going to worry.  She's actually lost a few ounces since I started giving this to her which is all the better since she has bad back legs.<br /><br />I totally trust Purina and have for many, many years for their quality products and attention to the proper nutrition for animals.  Nicely packaged so to keep it's freshness is a plus.<br /><br />I don't give my dog any wet food at all cause it upsets her tummy.  This is no  problem.  It's crunchy without being to brittle like some and I really can't complaign.  Will be using this for a long time to come for sure."}
