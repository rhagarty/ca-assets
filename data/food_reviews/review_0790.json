I DON'T LIKE TO WASTE MONEY ON DOG FOOD THAT THEY WILL NOT EAT.  so since this was free, why not try it  my dogs are also picky in what they choose to eat.  they themself's have elected NOT to eat sweets, even though i have offered it to them.  they don't eat crap like chips and popcorn.  so when i offered beneful to them they sniffed it, then took only \"1\" kibble.  they rolled it around in their mouth and then finally chewed it.  yes my dogs do this with new food introduced to them.  they then preceeded to SCARF this dog food up and even wanted more.  even though my dogs eat their vegetables,( they prefer baked califlower) i will now on add a cup of beneful to their dry food.  reading the label, this food is a good additive to a high protein diet for your dog.  hey 2 champion hunter/tracker/service dogs can't be wrong---WOOF"}
