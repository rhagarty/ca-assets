I guess Bush blew up the World Trade Center on purpose, too, to get people to buy more guard dogs and buy more dog food. While dogs certainly do like meat best, I have personally seen well-fed dogs pick raw corn off the stalk, and blueberries off the bush, and eat those things. I suspect dogs are omnivores, like bears. And if this food contains chicken feet or chicken brains, well, I've seen my dogs eat deer poop and months-old dead fish too. Just because my dog eats it doesn't mean I need to.<br /><br />Anyway, my dog ate this food but was not crazy about it. It is accepted if mixed with a small amount of canned food or table scraps. I could say the same thing about the \"Meaty Meal\" food I usually buy for 1/3rd the price of this stuff. I have just as much idea of the nutritional value of Meaty Meal as I do this stuff, so no, I'm not planning to buy any more of this stuff."}
