It gives food just the right amount of aroma and flavor. Nutiva is a major brand you can trust, though I've tried & used other brands from local healthfood stores as well. It annoys me that some books & health professionals still knock coconut oil as a fat to avoid on the premise that it's a naturally saturated fat, when in fact it's a tremendously healthy product. SOme say that it helps your body converts fat into energy better as well."}
