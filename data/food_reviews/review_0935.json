I use it for cooking and in my smoothies.  The flavor is wonderful, and it always seems to bring out the natural flavors of meat and seafood.  It has also helped me control and lose weight.  I weighed in at 205 lbs at the beginning of the year and with proper diet, exercise and a spoonful of coconut oil daily, I have lost 25 lbs.  If you want to cut out salt and sugar from your diet but not taste, try cooking with coconut oil.  It will enhance the flavors of your food and help you fix those nasty cravings."}
