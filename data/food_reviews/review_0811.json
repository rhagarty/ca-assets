Great taste and easy to prepare.<br /><br />I recently (2008.06.21) compared the Amazon 4-pack price ($6.27/can) with our local Gelson's Market, PP,CA ($4.99/can - not on sale).  While I find great savings on books, this is one example where the Amazon price isn't so great, and for me the front door delivery isn't offset by the large price difference.<br /><br />So the product gets 5-stars, the price gets 1-star.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
