After reading the many compliments via various websites I gave it a try.  I mainly use it for cooking, but also oral health after brushing my teeth.  Your teeth will feel like satin after placing a 1/2 tsp. in your mouth and allowing it to melt.  Swish it around, then rinse.  I've tried numerous brands and can't say enough about this one.  Well priced, clean tasting, a hint of coconut smell.  Top quality."}
