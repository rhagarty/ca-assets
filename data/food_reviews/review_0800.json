It almost has a hint of antiseptic smell to it, along with the sweet honey scent. And it tastes like it smells, but you do get used to it, and it is absolutely delicious. It is thinner and runnier than \"Really Raw\" brand american honey, so I find myself eating it faster, which is fine except I am about to run out shortly after buying it. But for me, an admittedly starving artist who is notoriously thrifty, it is still definitely worth the money.<br /><br />So what has it done for me?<br />It calms my heartburn, helps my digestion, reduces nausea associated with IBS, and I've used it on a skin infection with great success. All while being completely natural and delicious.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this honey - if you've read about the benefits of manuka honey you will be pleased to find that it does everything they says it does [and more].<br /><br />I will be ordering one more jar from Amazon, before moving to New Zealand at the end of the summer, where I will be quite excited to buy it locally!"}
