Next morning before you do anything, Stir, looking for a fairly stable consistancy and turn on a very low heat. Then return to getting ready for the day, returning to stir occasionally. It will be ready in 15-20 minutes. Great with Splenda/Brown surgar blend, banannas, strawberries, or whatever. Then a couple slices of Ezekeal toast with butter and flax seed oil. Be healthy.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
