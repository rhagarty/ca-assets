My routine:  put the water on to boil, brush teeth, put the oats in the boiling water, stir, lower heat to almost low, shower, blow hair dry, start coffee, stir oats, dress, put the oats in a bowl, put cold water in the pan, eat the oats and drink the coffee, wash the bowl and pan.  These oats are SO good, you don't need to add ANYTHING, not salt, not dairy, not spice, not fruit, not nuts.  Eat slowly, savor each bite.  Your taste buds will love you, your tummy will love you, your gut will love you, your heart will love you."}
