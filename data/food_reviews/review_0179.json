Then I mix in the noodles in. I  really liked them. They aren't really like rice or pasta, more like a chinese noodle. They do smell bad at first but I guess its an acquired taste. There is nothing rubbery about the texture if you cook them just right.  I ususally use the stove timer.  I decided to try these to cut back on calories."}
