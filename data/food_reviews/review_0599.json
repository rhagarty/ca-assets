I apply a little amount to my hair, just enough to cover it from the roots to the tips, and a little to the scalp, and let it on for a couple of hours. After that I wash my hair a couple of times to perfectly remove all the \"grease\", and for a few days, even after a one or two additional washes, my hair feels so full of body and shiny that I love it (If you have few hairs you must make the most of them!!!). Be careful: if you apply too much and do not wash your hair properly you might get the contrary effect (a greasy dead hair stuck to your scalp)<br /><br />It smells so good! just like a tropical sweet... I tasted it and it is not bad but it certainly smells better than it tastes... as a matter of fact I would say that it was almost tasteless to me. I read about the benefits of oil pulling (rinsing your mouth with it and making it pass between your teeth to remove bacteria) and it is not disgusting at all, I will continue and see how it turns out. This oil pulling alternative has also proven useful for a relative that has Alzheimer's disease as a complement to brushing his teeth, which he sometimes finds difficult to accomplish properly. Allegedly, oil pulling provides better results than using Listerine or similar mouth washes, which by the way can also be \"too spicy\" for children and the picky elderly because of their content of alcohol.<br /><br />I have also applied it over rashes in the skin and minor scratches. Many people cook with it too, although I have not tried it for cooking.","Description":"Multigrain Crunch"}
