What I settled on was Purina Beneful dry dog food. He can eat it without any stomach upset, and seems to like the flavor. With Purina Beneful dog food, he has been able to maintain what the vetrenarian calls a perfect weight, while having plenty of energy for his daily activities. So with the veteranarian giving my dog excellent marks for overall health and weight, I feel Purina Beneful seems to be just the right thing for him, without the need to turn to those overpriced boutique dog foods."}
