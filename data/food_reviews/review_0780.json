I take handfulls of antibiotics daily and heard others are having good results with this honey, which would be a welcome replacement to the pills.  It arrived undamaged, perfectly packaged, so I didn't have the issue some others had with shipping.  The honey itself is very thick and has sort of an astringent taste, but it's good and will taste good incorporated into teas, food, etc.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
