The noodles are transparent which I did not like and resembled the Chinese cellophane noodles used in soups. I looked up the Chinese noodles and found they were made with a similar base as the miracle noodles and could be bought at a lower price. When I used the noodles, they were okay but I would not order them again.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
