It was really slow going at first -- she couldn't figure out how to get the food out so she gave up really easily. About two weeks after we got it she finally figured it out and it is FANTASTIC.  It used to take her 30 seconds to finish her meals from a bowl and now it's about 20-30 minutes that keeps her fully occupied!  It has been the most valuable thing we've gotten for our dog!"}
