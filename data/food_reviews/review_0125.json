I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles. Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out using them in place of other types of noodles. Slightly expensive at Two dollars average for a seven ounce bag. But what diet food is cheap? I even decided to buy the rice noodles and want to give them a try as well. Will get back to you on my final opinion."}
