I was thrilled & thought I had a winner.  However by the next day everyone was a lot less enthusiastic.  By the 3rd day the previous days food was still in the bowl & they were begging to be fed.  After the disastrous results of the last food (Chef Micheal's) I tried out on them, I wasn't going to play around.  They aren't eating it.  I'm not forcing the issue.  I put them back on their regular food & they are chowing down & happy.<br /><br />Normally I feed everyone high quality brands of feed like Wellness & Before Grain etc.  I probably would have rated this lower if it wasn't for how sick the Chef Micheal's brand made everyone.  That & the other brand had even worse ingredients than this!  So for that, I would have to say Beneful is better but not quality.  Beneful is suitable for low income situations at best such as animal shelters or as a \"treat\" when higher quality feed is the main food given.  In the end cheap foods end up costing more due to dogs that get sick more often creating more trips to the vet.  When one considers the true cost of food, the higher priced higher quality foods are in the end more economical."}
