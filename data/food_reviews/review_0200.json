He loves most toys but usually tears them up. At first, he didn't know what to make of it as he thought it was a \"pull\" toy. Pulling on the rope actually puts a stopper on the bottle and the food doesn't come out. My 5 year old tried to \"show\" him and after a couple hours of on and off play he figured it out. He actually LOVES it and sometimes just carries it around empty or chews on the rope. You have to use small, hard food so it comes out easy. I tried crunching up small treats but it just stopped up the bottle. HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO KEEP DOGS ENTERTAINED AND BUSY.<br />UPDATE: This morning (one day after I wrote the above), I put his food in his bowl for breakfast. Usually he gulps it down quickly...this morning he looked at it, walked away and brought THIS TOY to me, dropping it down in front of the food. I put the food from his bowl into the toy and he immediately tipped it over to get the food out and was clearly having fun. IF THIS DOESN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH HE LOVES IT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES.:)"}
