Cooking, beauty, healthcare...I've used it in many different applications. The reason I took off a star is because when this shipped (in a warm month) it came liquified and upon solidifying became somewhat grainy. I tried a different brand that came the same way but solidified without any graininess. If you're not going to consume it straight out of the container this should not bother you at all."}
