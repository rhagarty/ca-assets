Honey has a tremendous amount of benefits!  I eat a table spoon before going to work and the gym.  It really gives you an energy boost, which is a lot better then those energy drinks!!!  It also helped me to get rid of a cold that I was starting to catch.<br />I also recommend you to read<br />Honey: The Gourmet Medicine (Paperback)<br />by Joe Traynor (Author)<br /><br />So what are you waiting for!!! Go get your Manuka Honey!!!"}
