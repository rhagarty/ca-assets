I thought for some reason it would be a small sample bag.  The bag is large and attractive with a heavy ziplock top.<br /><br />The food inside is multi sized and colorful but way too big for my Chihuahua's to eat.  Also, I worry about all that extra dye in the food. Dogs can't see color, so the company is making the food look appetizing solely for the human owner. I picked out some of the smaller pieces of kibble but neither dog nor the cats were interested..hmmmmmmmm. While my animals usually eat \"Taste of the Wild\" food, I know the dogs are picky eats but the cats eat everything, including bugs so it was a little weird they wouldn't touch it.<br /><br />I decided to have a look at the ingredients-it was mostly corn.  One cat will eat corn of the cob so perhaps if I had wet it down he would have eaten it LOL.  On a serious note, corn as a main ingredient isn't really too \"beneficial\" to the health of a dog. I suppose this food is better quality than a lot of grocery store dog foods but it really as \"healthy\" as the advertising would make you think it was.  Not a bad food but not the best either. It's a shame-all the advertising and makeing the food look pretty but not spending that $$ on making it good for the dogs.<br /><br />Rather than throw away 15 lbs of perfectly good food, I found a local animal rescue that happily wanted the donation of the bag of food."}
