Our dog Champ has a hearty appetite so we just knew he would love this, but it took him awhile to actually like it because he would only eat a little and then walk away but eventually he would return to finish eating. The next time I fed it to him I opened up a can of his other dog food and spruced it up just a little for him. My experiment of mixing in one of his favorite canned food and I put most of the canned food in the middle and on the bottom of his bowl and this got him a little bit more excited about Purina Beneful. I think that Beneful will take maybe a few tries before your dog will start to really enjoy it but I think that the ingredients are healthy enough for Champ and I want him to receive all of the benefits that Purina Beneful has to offer.<br /><br />He does appear to be a little more lively than usual and I want to attribute that to the change in his diet, but I'm not entirely sure. I love that my dog is happy and has an extra spring in his step, so I'll keep feeding him this until he isn't interested anymore or if there is a negative change in behavior. I like this food for my dog,but it needs a little more oomph to get dogs immediately excited."}
