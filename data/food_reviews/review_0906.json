I get biweekly pedicures but that gets expensive!  One of the reviewers recommended applying coconut oil daily and you'll never have to worry about rough feet again.  I have to honestly admit that she was right!  I only get a pedicure for the pampering every couple of months no longer the necessity and because of the results I apply the coconut oil to my entire body after the bath and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture.  It's unbelievable.  The only thing about this one is during the summer months you have to find a cool place in the house to keep this such as underneath the bathroom cabinet or in the linen closet because it will liquify.  As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.  But I love, love, love this product.  It's a must have.  It's has a light, chocolate fragrance to it which is a plus."}
