The Pit Bull holds her paws around the rubber ring and turns it over to pour some out. The Heinz 57 bats it around until something falls out, just beginning to hold the rope with 1 paw and hit the jug with the other. They are tied for time to get all the treats out!<br /><br />This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors - too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs. It would work in a crate, but I won't leave my dogs alone with ANY toy of this sort.<br /><br />It is hard to find dog goodies that will come out most are too thick to pass through. Charlee Bear Treats(any flavor) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002QX3Q0\">Charlee Bear Dog Treats 16Oz Zip Pack Cheese/Egg</a> work perfectly as do larger sized cat treats. I love watching the dogs as they figure out a new way to make it work. No one has eaten off the rubber ring (the toy would still work if they did) and no one has chewed off the rope. (You could replace the rope or put in some sort of ball as someone else did.)<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars except for the noise on hard floors."}
