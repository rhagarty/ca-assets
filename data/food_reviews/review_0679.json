And folks, the absolute truth is she will ONLY eat this particular brand and flavor of dog food.  Now, whether or not that means it is good stuff is a highly subjective thing.  Since the humans here at home don't consume it, we can only go by Molly's ( a small cocker) enthusiasm for it and the fact she will refuse to eat ANY other type of food, both canned or dry. (she does, however, love Beggin' Strips)<br /><br />Now I have seen and read many reviews that proclaim this dog food as one of the very worst you can buy and for numerous reasons. The bottom line for me is our dog Molly has reached 14 years of age and is in reasonably good health, other than some arthritis, a bit of incontinence and being deaf. Whether that is because of this food or IN SPITE OF IT is beyond my knowledge.<br /><br />Basically, our dog loves this stuff, turns her nose up at ANYTHING else (except Beggin' Strips) and has reached the ripe old age of 14 and still chases me all over the house.  While I am sure you could find many people on both sides of the \"This stuff is great\" / \"This stuff is garbage\" issue, I can only tell you what we have experienced and how much our dog loves Purina Beneful."}
