It took her about a day to figure out the fastest way to get to the treats, but even so it still takes her some time to work everything out of it.  It's better than other treat-dispensing toys I have which make the treats either too easy or too difficult to get out.  The only reason I wouldn't give this toy 5 stars is that my dog was able to chew right through the attached rope within the first hour of playing with it, so that part of it was not too durable.  Still, even without the rope it's a good product."}
