Though it is not what I would call miraculous I would say it does a nice job. I have sensitive skin, and this seems to work as well or better than most moisturizers I have tried, plus you can eat it. It has a coconut flavor to it. Subtle, and not sweet like a Peter Paul Mounds bar. I believe it helps a little as a laxative, but that might be me wishing it to do so. Anyway, just a small amount goes a long way, and my skin feels less sensitive and cooler. I'm a guy, and not looking for silky smooth skin, but this does that also.<br />This stays a solid until it touches your hand, then it melts quickly. This summer I may need to refridgerate so it stays solid, or knowing me, I'll spill it all over the place. Large jar for low cost. I'd give it a go.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
