I dont have any gastrointestinal problems so I cannot comment on its effectiveness. It has a mild floral scent and the taste is favorable. I use regular honey from Costco  but I like  the smell and taste of the Wedderspoon more.  I would reorder again, but will use it sparingly due to the high cost."}
