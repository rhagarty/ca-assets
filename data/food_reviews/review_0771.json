There's a \"ziploc\" zipper at the top, which is just awesome. The dog food we typically buy does not have this feature, so we have to use storage containers with lids to keep the food fresh(and the rats away). The zipper makes things much easier, to me.<br /><br />My dogs aren't picky eaters! There's only been one brand that they didn't eat, and this isn't it. My indoor dog still prefers his long-time favorite, though. Despite the fact that they eat it fine, I don't like that the main ingredient is corn. Looking at the front of the bag, though, I guess that's to be expected. The ear of corn seems to be the most noticeable ingredient.<br /><br />Overall, the packaging is great, but the food is just okay."}
