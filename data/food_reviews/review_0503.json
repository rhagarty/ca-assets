I have tried other coconut oils, and they are not the quality of Nutiva.  You can use this for so many things.  It is a great, light-weight moisturizer.  I also love to put it on my hair.  It adds a great taste to smoothies, and I have also used it to cook with.  This is a very versatile product.  I love it."}
