Of course, they love it more when there are treats in it but they love to play with it even when it's empty! Though if you have more than one dog, I would suggest one for each. The bottle is made from 'bullet proof' material and is really hard and could cause some damage if it's being swung around and fought over. Over all though, I am really happy with this purchase. It's great to watch the dogs figure this out!!"}
