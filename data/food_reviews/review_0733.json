I mixed it with Taste of the Wild which is grain free (and the mixture might be seen as sacrilege for the purists), but the dogs enjoyed it solo and in the mixture. I do notice they eat it by color though. The red kibble bits go first. Actually one dog loves the red kibble bits so much she dumps the whole bowl to get the red ones. Then goes the green, and finally the brown bits. Not sure what that is about, but it seems to be pretty standard by now. She actually started to growl when the other dogs came to eat before she was done with the red bits.<br /><br />The bag is easy to open and can be zipped closed, which I appreciate. The kibble size is relatively small, so for my mini doxies, it is pretty perfect. My sister's yellow lab came by, though, and I am fairly certain he didn't even have to chew- just inhaled and the bowl was empty. So I think this food is fine, but nutritionally questionable..."}
