I found the taste a little odd at first but am now hooked and eat it every morning on toast.  I am convinced it has helped clear up my gastritis (diet related not hpylori).  I have been buying it at Wholefoods for $29.99 but just found it at Wegman's in the organic section for $24.99.  This is by far the best price I've seen for this same Wedderspoon's Manuka Honey Active 16+.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
