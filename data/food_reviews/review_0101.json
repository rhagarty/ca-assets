I find that the cube, even on its \"hardest\" setting only takes a few minutes to get out most of the food, and then the rest doesn't come out no matter how long the dogs work it.  With the bottle the dogs can get nearly all the food out if they keep at it.<br /><br />At first you should fill the bottle so that it is over half full.  This way food can come out more easily when it is on its side.  This will encourage the dog to play with it.  Once the food level goes down food will only come out as they toss and pull the bottle.  It took my dog a few days to get to this, but now she seems to have mastered it.  She stands the bottle up and knocks it over, putting food into the neck, then she works the rope a bit and manages to get a piece of kibble out.  When I first got the toy I thought she would never be able to figure it out, but she has.  Even so, it takes a fair amount of work to get out just a few pieces of food, so it can keep them occupied all day."}
