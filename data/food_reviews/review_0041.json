The first one lasted a really long time but our home is all hardwood flooring and my dog is so obsessed with this toy, she carries it around and drops it on the floor in front of us when she wants us to fill it!  This has resulted in the bottom screw caps breaking pretty quickly and she is now on her 5th one.  She broke two in one week.  Problem has been solved by no longer letting her carry it around the house, however, it would be nice if Premier could come up with a more shock resistant plastic to use.  I give it 5 starts due to the love my dog has for this toy but I wish it was more durable."}
