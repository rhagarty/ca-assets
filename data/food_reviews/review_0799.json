I've been on every Rx antacid known, the last being Aciphex which is very strong and costs me $167 for 30 pills with insurance. I tried this honey after reading of its capabilities but believing that it was just a high priced scam, but I'm desperate for releif so I spent the $28. 3 days after eating 1 tsp on bread per day my stomach pain was gone. I couldn't beleive it. I'm still waiting for it to return but it's been a couple of weeks now and I feel great. In the past I've had to give up coffee, beer, spicy food, chocolate, etc. and still had gnawing pain. If you have stomach problems try this. I'm going to tell my Dr. about it.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
