This keeps my 33-lb/4-month-old puppy busy for a good 20 minutes and after he's eaten all the food, he can chew on the rope. It's easy to clean, which is a BIG plus! This is a wonderful alternative to the Buster Cube. I also have the small Twist and Treat and both are great toys to keep him occupied."}
