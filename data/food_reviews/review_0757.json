I have been mixing the chicken and lamb Kirkland brand with the more expensive Organic Kirkland mix. My two dog's (Akita and Black Lab) have been eating their food for a couple of years now and seemed to be enjoying it enough. However when I added the Beneful to the mix of the other two foods they absolutely loved it. They ate it in record time. Wow what enthusiasm. I have since run out of this 15.5 lb bag and purchased some more from Costco. Now they hardly eat the Kirkland brand. I had to go and purchase a 50 lb bag of Beneful and mix it in again to get them to eat their food.<br /><br />I don't know how it tastes but I can say that my dogs both love it. I have been adding diatomaceous earth powder to their bowls mixed with one raw egg lately and they are really liking it. They seem to have more energy too. I am trying to rid them of any internal parasites. I am also rubbing it into their coats to control fleas and ticks."}
