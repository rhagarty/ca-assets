Normally it comes to my home ok. But in the summer, the oil turns from solid to liquid (above 78 F ambient), and sometimes the seal on the jar does not hold. This is what happened recently. AMZ happily replaced the shipment, but the real problem is with the manufacturer, who needs a more dependable seal."}
