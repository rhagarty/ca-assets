I was able to orally take 4 TBS daily within 2 weeks of starting this oil with no diarrhea. It brought my blood pressure down from 150/80 to 126/62. My skin soaks it up and looks younger. I eat it with my meals. It has a mild, pleasant coconut taste. It is doing many good things internally that Iam not even aware of."}
