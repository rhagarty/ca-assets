This toy keeps Max well-occupied for long periods on end.  I started out by really filling the bottle and using smaller treats that would more easily dispense, and once he got the hang of it, used larger treats for increased challenge.  While the tassel on the end of tug rope has been worse for the wear, the rope has withstood Max's chewing well.  Max has been able to figure out various ways of getting to the treats--rolling the bottle around, up-ending it, then knocking it over and tugging on the rope to dispense the treats...As the label says, Max is able to smell, see and hear the treats, and this keeps him interested for hours of play.  I've learned however, that I really have to screw the bottom on extra tightly, as on one occasion he somehow managed to loosen it by repeatedly rolling the bottle, and was able to get to all the treats at once! Suffice to say, he did not have much of an appetite for his evening meal after that!! At the same time I purchased this, I also purchased two Kongs; however, Max prefers the Tug-a-Jug hands down, and generally ignores his other toys--even his previously favourite tug rope--in favour of playing with the Tug-a-Jug All in all, Max rates this toy with 5-stars and thinks his mommy made a wise buy!"}
