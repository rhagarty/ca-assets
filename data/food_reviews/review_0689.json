I do try different brands but when I need something that will work for every day use, I usually buy this. I picked this because it has soft morsels, which I thought my smaller dog would be able to chew better. I know the main ingredient is corn, but I have to believe that the formulation isn't going to kill him. Sure, there may be higher quality foods out there, at a higher price, and I've tried a few, but my dog looks and acts the same and eats them just like he eats Beneful."}
