This one came up safe.<br />I checked with my doctor/specialist and she had heard the same thing.<br />I also heard on Oprah that this is all she'll eat, so I tried them. Once you get used to it, you'll never go back to that bowl of slime.<br /><br />PS: Whole grains are SUPPOSED to take longer to cook because they aren't broken down. So try it!"}
