And so far so good! I combine it with pure organic cold pressed olive oil- my hair loves it.<br /><br />The quality and texture are great.<br />I like the containers- they're plastic jars which makes storing them a breeze.<br /><br />I also use this on my skin sometimes, and it works GREAT.  It really saturates into the skin- makes it very smooth and extremely soft. I actually use the olive oil/coconut oil combo on my skin, so I guess its both products at work... but either way it goes it'll leave you with softer skin.<br /><br />It's a little messy for me because I have to transfer it into a smaller bottle, but I just started using the top of a straw/sippy cup as a funnel and that helps. The smell is strong, if you like coconut you'll love this. I'm not that huge on it, so at times its a bit much for me.<br /><br />This is the best deal on on this product you'll find- 2 for $16 (and free shipping if you spend $25)... but I still wish it was more like 2 for $10."}
