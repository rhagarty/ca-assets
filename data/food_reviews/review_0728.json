You want me to eat THAT?\".  When I offered him Beneful for the first time, he sniffed it, and promptly started eating.  It was nice to see him accept a new type of food so quickly, and I know that he will be eating this for the rest of his days, and any other dogs that I may adopt at some point in the future will also eat Beneful."}
