My 60 lb. mostly Dingo mix's strategy is to pick it up by the bottle and let it drop on the rope. When the rope hits the ground a few kibbled treats are released. This was tough for him to figure out. However, he has many different feeding toys and he doesn't give up.","Description":"Shredded Wheat"}
