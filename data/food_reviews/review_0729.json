The gleaming white package with healthy, beautiful veggies on the cover.<br />HA! Check out this ingredient list!<br /><br /> Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrochloride, dried peas, dried carrots, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate (s preservative), choline chloride, vitamin supplements (E, A, B12, D3), added color (yellow #5, red #40, yellow #6, blue #2), dl-methionine, zinc sulfate, glyceryl monostearate, ferrous sulfate, niacin, manganese sulfate, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin supplement, biotin, thiamine mononitrate, garlic oil, copper sulfate,<br /><br />YOU have to get past TWENTY foul sounding ingredients to get to the TWO pitiful listings of veg. This is junk food for dogs in a pretty package! Dogs are carnivores, all that grain is NOT good for them. They are just going to eat it in one end and potty it out the other, with very little nutrition staying with them. So, they are going to way more of it trying to get full!<br /><br />Not the food I am going to give my canines; who, by the way, would not touch this stuff!"}
