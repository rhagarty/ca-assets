So I force myself to take it for all of the REAL AND TRUE health benefits that comes from it. One day I come across this expensive and raved about type of honey and I dare to be brave because I really do want to benefit from it. But I am terrified that I am going to have a problem with the taste and I actually prayed about it when I was about to take my dutiful teaspoonful and BAM - it was delicious! It tastes like cherries, lol.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
