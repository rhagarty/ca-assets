I love the texture of steel cut oats, and McCann's is one of the better brands (not all steel cut oats are the same). They taste great and are easy to prepare, either by using a rice cooker, slow cooker/crockpot, or preparing the night before by boiling half the required liquid, adding the oats, then cover and remove from the stove and let it sit overnight. Add a little more liquid if needed the next day, nuke in the microwave and its good to go! Try adding peanut butter and cocoa powder with one packet of Splenda per serving, dried fruit, cinnamon and brown sugar, or even a spoon of canned pie filling such as apple or cherry.<br /><br />Others have mentioned problems with the packaging and receiving dented cans, but I think Amazon has fixed that problem. My 4 cans came shrink-wrapped together, along with a sturdy cardboard bottom. That was inside a larger box with a bunch of air pillows for padding, so the cans are completely unblemished."}
