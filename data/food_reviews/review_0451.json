This makes the BEST pie crust and biscuits ever. We also switched from  butter to coconut oil for frying eggs and it requires a lot less to get the job done. Great product and I will be buying more when we run out. Oh, also I am an extremely picky eater and coconut is a flavor I can not tolerate at all...I can not taste any coconut flavor using this so I'm a very happy camper."}
