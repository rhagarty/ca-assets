After him beating up some of his stuffed animals, I knew i needed to provide something more durable and safe.  I came across this while searching for dog toys, and loved the idea that it is not only a toy, but a reward/education system.  After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall)."}
