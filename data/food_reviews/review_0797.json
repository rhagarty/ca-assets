I can't remember if there was any particular reason other than the peculiar habit one of the Jack Russells had of picking out the round green bits.  I would pour a bowl out for her then when I came back it would be gone except for a circle of green bits around the bowl.<br /><br />However, my current dogs have no objection to the green bits and seem to thrive on having this added to their diet.  (If you are going to change from one dogfood to another it's better on their stomach to ease them in by adding a small amount to their regular dog food.)"}
