Wasn't sure if first if they would get the hang of it but it took no time at all.  Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories), I fill these with Cheerio's (or some frozen sliced carrrots or peas) and a few larger milkbones and they go nuts.  The larger milkbones are added just to make it a little tougher.  It's a great learning toy or busy toy - hence the name.  All I have to ask my little Puggies is, \"do you want your bottle\" and that's all they need.  We couldn't live without it.  Oh and I've had ours for probably a year and a half and we're not even close to needing to replace them."}
