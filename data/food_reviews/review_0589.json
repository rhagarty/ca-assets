The taste is amazingly good too! Since it came in two tubs, I have one in the kitchen for consumption and the other one in my bathroom for my hair since I researched and found that coconut oil is supposed to be good for natural hair. My mane is definitely softer to touch although it is typically not course or difficult to manage. I just got it last week so will see how it goes. The hot oil treatment with coconut oil is next on my to-do list. Careful when you use it on hair though, when I don't wrap my hair, I wake up with zits (prolly from the oil on my pillow). Some say it works to relieve acne, some say it causes acne. I blame it for the acne I have since I had been acne free for weeks until I applied the coconut oil on my hair.<br /><br />Overrall, I will be a regular buyer of this product.","Description":"Multigrain Crunch"}
