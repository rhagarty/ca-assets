It smells so amazing. I apply it to my hair as an light moisturizer oil. I also use it along with my body lotion on my skin. Furthermore I cook with it. I purchase this oil 3 times and gave my boyfriend a 150z jar since he has an extremely dry skin. He loves it. His skin looks much better, less dry, and smoother. He also cooks with it.<br /><br />The value for the 54oz jar is the best. Will buy more in the future!"}
