Sometimes, though, the base can be difficult to screw back on after filling it with kibble.<br /><br />I have used the toy with my 8-month-old, medium-sized dog 3 times now, putting her kibble meal inside instead of treats. The first time she used it, she was frustrated and confused, and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while. The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left! This surprised me that she was so quick, but a similar thing happened when I introduced her to the Kong. It was quite hard the first time; but, after that, she seemed to have easy success.","Description":"Shredded Wheat"}
