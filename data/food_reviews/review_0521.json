We use one jar for full body massage and the other for cooking. Simply use a knife to carve out chunks of oil - if you want to heat the oil up for massage, simply float a small bowl of oil in a larger bowl of hot water, and in no time you'll have silky warm oil, ready to lavish on your lover's body. Equally delicious in the bedroom and the kitchen, this oil will come to be a favored tool of pleasure in your home. Enjoy!"}
