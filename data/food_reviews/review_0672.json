We have three dogs, they are all quite finicky eaters (i.e. spoilt!) and are known to turn their nose up at some quality brands, they did not exactly rush to this, but they did eat it all which is a big plus, because dog food is just not cheap anymore.<br />One of our dogs tends to shed a lot of hair with some of the cheaper brands, she did not do this with this product.<br /><br />A small tip, I saved the bag and re-used it for another Purina and non-Purina product and it saved both from drying up and becoming stale!<br />In my opinion it is a well balanced dog-food that the dogs will readily eat."}
