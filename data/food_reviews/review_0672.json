I have tried brushing their teeth with doggie toothpaste and have bought all kinds of chewy treats but nothing worked. So I bought these and gave each dog a treat every morning.  Not only does their breath smell better but their teeth look cleaner as well. I quickly bought a second box. The dogs seem to enjoy the taste and they are made so that the dog can't just gulp them down.  They have to chew them.  I would highly recommend these treats."}
