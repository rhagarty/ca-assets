Since reading that olive oil is best just used for cold, not cooked items, I use it for cooking as well as a condiment on sandwiches, a spread on whole grain breads, and even added to protein shakes. It is soooo healthy. Anyone reading up on it should make sure they are reading current info--not old, no longer valid statements. I even use it on my face.<br />I ordered a jar to see if I liked it, which I do, and have since gone on Amazon's auto-ship program: Couldn't be more convenient. Good price savings, too."}
