He has been an Iams dog for years...which he picks at. He saw this being opened and went crazy for it. Now, I have to admit that it is probably not the \"best\" in terms of ingredients, but we found that by mixing a bit here and there, he was happy and I didn't feel guilty. I am back to buy a bag this time! I'm glad we had the opportunity to try it! I am always afraid to try a different food for fear it will upset their digestive system, but I'm pleased to say that all was fine!  Give it a try!"}
