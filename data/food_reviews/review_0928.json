So I'll make it short.  I've bought one other brand of coconut oil besides this, and they both are about the same,  except that this brand stand in a more liquid form longer than the other brand.  (which turns out to be great when adding it to homemade ice cream!)  Besides that I was satisfied with both.  I bought this because it was more economical.  I didn't think I'd like the subscription program, but it's turning out to be VERY convenient.  I was able to change the options around right before delivery, and it comes just like it should.  Plus, I know the product and the price I'm getting without having to make the arduous health food store comparison shopping drive.<br /><br />That's about the best you can ask for a product like this.  If it's going to cost more than regular butter and oil, at least it's a good product, and comes without me going to fetch it."}
