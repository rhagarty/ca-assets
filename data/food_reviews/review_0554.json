The two containers were bubble wrapped with no other packaging around them so they were rolling around in the box while in transit. I called Nutiva who said that Amazon was the seller and packager of their product. (The guy also said that Amazon has some of the worst packaging of items like this in the industry.) The Nutiva guy said that I got a really good price on their product, but with results like I had, I guess I didn't get a good deal as only one container was sealed and safe to use. I am a huge Amazon fan for many things, but unless I get assurances for packaging improvements, I will hesitate before ordering perishable items in the future."}
