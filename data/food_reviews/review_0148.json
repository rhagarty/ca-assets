Rinse them off in a colander when you open the package--to get rid of the fishy smell.<br />2. Pour boiling water over them.<br />3. Cut them up into short pieces with a knife--otherwise they're really long, and the texture is a bit much.<br />4. Add them to soup or broth and heat well. Use strong seasonings, such as chilis or hot sauce. They aren't all that good at absorbing mild flavors.<br /><br />When I go through all those steps, they're actually not bad tasting, they're quite filling, and the noodles themselves are calorie free."}
