These were very much like vermicelli, or rice noodles, that we get at one of my favorite asian restaurants.  They don't have much flavor on their own, but take on whatever sauce or flavor you add.  I was intimidated to try them after all the \"OMG THEY SMELL LIKE FISH\" reviews... maybe I'm just used to asain-type foods, but these only smelled only SLIGHTLY fishy-something I would expect from a product shipped in liquid.  Honestly, I've had \"shrimp-chips\" that smelled FAR more pungent and fishy than these noodles.  If you like asain foods, don't let the reviews scare you away.  These are a great alternative to regular pastas."}
