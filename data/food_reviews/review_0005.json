He is a constant busy-body and this toy provides hours of entertianment for him. My concern was the durability becasue he can chew through most everything immediately.... not this toy! It is by far the most durable!!! He did eventually chew through the rope, which I removed and he continues to play with this and carry it around most of the day. Our other little Springer Spaniel loved it so much that after months of fighting over it, I bought Wrigley one for his 1st birthday last month. I was so pleased with the first one, I also purchased the Preimer Waggle for him. If it is possible, this toy is even more entertaining than the other! Hard to believe ... these toys have kept our puppies busy, entertained and constantly concentrating and working on getting the treats out! I love them!"}
