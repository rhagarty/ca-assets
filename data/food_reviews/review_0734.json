The first ingredient is corn, which is the first ingredient in most crunchy snack foods.  If you feed your dog this as it's main food, it's  almost like feeding your child a straight diet of Doritos.  They may taste good, but they won't keep you healthy for long.  It's not a bad dog food, and there are a lot worse brands out there, and it'll do when money is tight and you need to feed your dog.  Today I saw a 42 lb bag of Purina Beneful at SAM's club for right at 32 dollars."}
