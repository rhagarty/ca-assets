He absolutely loves it, and I recommend it to anyone.  I bought mine before they 'upgraded' to a rubber rope part, but he has only gotten the knot open once so it's not a problem.  It dispenses food quickly enough to keep him interested, and even once he's done eating he still likes to chew on the rubber and rope a little.  I think it was definitely worth the money and recommended it to our local vet who is now carrying it in stock."}
