They have no taste of their own but absorb the taste of what you mix them in. The smell is mildly unpleasant but goes away with rinsing. Preparation is fairly easy and quick. I can see these being useful on a short-term low-carb diet as a filler, but certainly not long-term. You'd get about the same thing if you bought a can of bamboo shoots used to make chop suey, and it would be a lot cheaper."}
