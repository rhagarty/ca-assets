I love the scent, the taste & the texture. It is absolutely wonderful in baking products (especially chocolate cake!), and actually fries quite well, too.<br />This is one of the few oils that I can drink straight from the container (only in small amounts, though! lol!). It also mixes well with hot chocolate or tea.<br />The health benefits are terrific as well!"}
