It seemed to be the perfect combination of things he adores:  rope, bottles, noise, and chewable plastic.  We bought treats, showed him the treats inside (and they were good and stinky - his favorites), swung the thing around in the air a couple of times.  He was very interested, and we thought \"this is it!\".  We tossed the toy in front of him.  He smells it, pawed it once, and then nothing.  OK, that's fine.  Sometimes toys take a little warm up period.  So we grabbed it up, acted like it was great fun, teased him with the rope, tossed it, ran to get it, and did all the things that usually get our heeler into a playing frenzy.  Oh, he was ready to play.  But when he'd run to the toy - that was it.  \"Oh - it's still this toy, huh?\"  Nothing.  We tried multiple times - nothing.<br /><br />This toy has all the makings of a good toy, but just didn't hit the mark.  It's very durable - because it will never get played with!  What a shame, too, because it's a great looking toy.  For a dog that loves just about every toy, he doesn't like this.  Two paws down.","Description":"Shredded Wheat"}
