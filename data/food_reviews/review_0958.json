My home is constantly over 76F, so it is always a liquid.  When it arrived, the box was partially soaked with coconut oil.  I can't find the leak and the bottle and inner seal seems to be ok.  Since I only use it for hair and skin care, I am keeping it.<br /><br />The smell is really nice and not overwhelming.  Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.  But whether it does anything to the skin long term is another story.<br /><br />BTW, many other oils are near odourless.  This oil is the exception that have a faint coconut odour to it."}
