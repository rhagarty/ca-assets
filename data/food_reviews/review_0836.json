I am trying to lower my cholesterol and I am not fond of rolled oats.  I was a bit disappointed in this product.  I guess that I expected a better textured oatmeal, but I was not pleased with the \"brown rice\" cooked product.  Yes, it was like eating brown rice for breakfast - not that I have anything against brown rice.  This oatmeal does have a little more flavor than regular rolled oats oatmeal.  I also don't have time to cook oatmeal every morning for at least 30 minutes, so I guess you could say that I don't have time for these oats.  If you have the time and like oatmeal to begin with, you may like these.  If you don't like oatmeal and don't have a bunch of time to spend cooking these, then I wouldn't suggest buying them.  Personally, I am going back to eating old fashioned rolled oats - 3 minutes in the microwave and they are done.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
