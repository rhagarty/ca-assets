I'm used to making substitutions in my low-carb lifestyle, and I went into this with an open mind.  I knew they wouldn't be starchy like real pasta noodles.  I prepared myself for the smell, thinking that carb-free pasta is worth any smell that washes off; oddly enough, the packages I got had little or no odor at all.  I followed the directions exactly the first time, then followed a few suggestions from people I know who loves these things in an attempt to make them work for me.  In the end, I just couldn't get past the texture.  I tried making them less firm, more firm, keeping them really hot...nothing worked to get me past that gelatinous, slipperly, worm-iness.  The first bite wasn't too bad, but after a couple more, I completely lost my appetite.  Flavor-wise, these really will just take on the taste of whatever you put on, or in them.  But texture and appearance are big factors for me in food, and these clear, sinewy-textured attempts at noodliness were just not appetizing for me.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
