The downside to that, however, is that the cans often arrive damaged.  In my last order, every can had deep dents.<br /><br />As for the cooking, I usually make many servings at a time and store in the fridge.  This way there is only one pot to wash and a two minute wait for it to warm up in the microwave.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
