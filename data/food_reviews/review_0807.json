The rolled oats are fine when I'm in a hurry.  When there is time, steel cut is the way to go.  These McCann's oats are pretty good.  When I have a lot of time, I use Alton Brown's overnight oatmeal recipe as a starting point.  My recipe is basically a cup of oats, 3 cups water, a 1 cup milk, and a cup or two of dried fruity stuff if any is handy.  It goes into a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4FTZU\">crock pot</a> and cooks overnight.  I cook mine on medium.<br /><br />Next time I order oats I'm going to try out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007NG56S\">Steel Cut Oats Pinhead Oatmeal - Bulk 50 Pound Bag</a>.  The price is too good."}
