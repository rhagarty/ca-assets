I have included them in soups, with egg whites to bulk out a diet \"omelet\" with tons of sauteed veggies folded in and as a stand in for regular noodles with homemade pea and basil pesto.<br />DO RINSE WELL!!  To some of the other comments about the smell:....Yes, they do smell a bit fishy.  Do not stick your nose in the bag.  Since it smells a bit fishy, if you don't like that smell, don't give yourself a snoot full! Just snip, dump into a colander and rinse well, drain and repeat. I follow up by tossing them in the pan that held the veggies for a few minutes to heat them up and get rid of any residual packaging odors.<br />Try tossing them in a bit of ginger and soy sauce and then chilling to add to fresh Thai veggie wraps with basil, grated carrot, shredded cabbage, radish, mint etc and wrap in a leaf of butter lettuce and dip in some sweet chili sauce combined with some veggie stock. (gotta watch those sauces as calories can sneak right back into a low cal meal in seconds.)"}
