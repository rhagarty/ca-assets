It did not work well for me for indigestion. It does make a nice facial mask mixed with Fullers Clay for my rosacea sensitive skin.<br />Not sure I'd buy this honey again considering the high cost.<br />It did come with a seal over the honey so no leakage as previously<br />noted by other reviewers.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
