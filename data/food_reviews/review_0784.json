That is definitely a plus.  However, as otherwise  noted, Beneful could be a bit more on the nutritious side (I'd much rather prefer less ingredients and meat as the prime ingredients, but that's me, as a human, talking).  The main thing is that the dogs (who can be picky) are willing to eat the food and they appear to be thriving on it."}
