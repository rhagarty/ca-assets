It has been like that for about 2 weeks and the prescription med my doctor prescribed (pantoprazole) isn't helping at all. Antacid (Tums) do help my condition somehow but I still need to deal with them everyday and I was taking like 10-14 antacid tablets per day, to somehow ease my discomfort.<br /><br />Then I read online about this natural remedy and was quickly turned off by the price. But the discomfort is really annoying, and I haven't had too much luck with natural supplements (they usually take a long time for you to feel any effect) so I was skeptic. Saw this at my local Whole Food and then finally decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />And here I am, writing my first Amazon review. Day 1 I feel a little better, seems to calm it a little bit, day 2 I only felt some slight discomfort througout the day. And by day 4, the only time I feel anything is when I try to sleep at night, but even so it is very very light discomfort. And I no longer feel ANY discomfort in the daytime, NONE! So far I have only been taking this for about 5 days and already a very happy man. I stopped taking medications and just half tea spoon 3 times a day. I'm gonna order a bunch of these from amazon now!","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
