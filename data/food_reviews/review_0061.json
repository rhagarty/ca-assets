Just looking at it, I figured there was no way they could figure out how to get the treats out.  I planned on giving it to my son who has bigger more active dogs.  Well, I put treats in one and put it down and one of my dogs took possession of it and worked for an hour at getting the treats.  She absolutely loves this toy, and will perk up and follow me when I pick them up to fill.  Yes, I kept both of them, just in case the other dogs took an interest.  Paws up on this one!!"}
