We have 3 dogs, Gracie(13+boxer), Annie (2.5 mix) Jo(2 boxer) I bought 2. I thought I should have gotten the smaller one but, Jo loves it. Gracie is getting into it too. Annie just waits for the treats to come out when the other 2 play with it. All 3 dogs are 55-60 lbs.  It's great if your dog takes to it. Hit or miss on that one. If they do it's a great occupier of time. I have been filling it with their regular super premium dog food and a little bit of Beneful dog food kibbles & bits for variety. So no expensive treats. Jo has been gnawing on the end ball and it shows no sign of wear. Not even teeth marks. Best $$ spent on any toy, ever."}
