I found that I could not chew them and the only way I could eat them was to swallow them whole.  This defeated the purpose of enjoying a noodle without the guilt.  The saying \"If its too good to be true, it probably is\" applies here.  Stick to the diet without these noodles.  You are just throwing your money down the drain by purchasing them."}
