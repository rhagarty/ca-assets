When you have two dogs such as we it is PleasantVille.  Beneful is one of their favorites and it shows.  The male Yorky goes after the big, red ones as if each was his and his only while the female Yorky settles for the smaller and easier to eat pieces.  When mealtime is over so is the Beneful.  They are proud members of the clean plate society and eagerly enjoy their menue.  These old dogs are just as peculiar as many old critters we know.  Present company included.  So for them to honestly enjoy their meals is something of an anomaly and we appreciate the Purina company for helping with us with a few moments of peace and quiet."}
