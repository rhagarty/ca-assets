I am caucasian with blonde highlighted hair. My hair strands are fine but I do have a lot of hair and it is relatively long. My scalp is also naturally a little oily. My hair is healthy, but I do need deep conditioning though as I expose my hair to a lot of elements. (I give all of this detail in case someone is making the decision for themselves as identifies with my hair profile.)<br /><br />My Hubby is a hairdresser / salon owner and because of this I get to try all kinds of hair products.  I've even had expensive caviar shampoo and conditioner (As I roll my eyes). I've used other oils in my hair and most require several washings to get the oil out.  Not this Coconut Oil.  I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap a satin wrapping cap around it while I sleep.  (available near the relaxer s in the hair care section of the store) When I wake I shampoo an condition like normal and my hair looks amazing! I use it twice a week now!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Nothing and I mean nothing has made my hair feel as silky and look as shiny as this Coconut Oil.<br /><br />The oil starts out think like crisco but melts in your hands when rubbed together quickly.  This consistency makes it super easy to apply.<br /><br />It isn't runny or drippy.<br /><br />Amazingly \"repairs\" hair after too much sun, surf, chlorine etc.<br /><br />When washed it does not leave a fragrance behind.<br /><br />No Chemicals! 100% Organic and good for you!<br /><br />THE TRICKY<br /><br />It smell of the coconut is rich and luscious and I love it -  but it was hard to ignore it when I woke up or turned over in the night.  It only took about two applications though for me to get used to it."}
