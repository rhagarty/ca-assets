I ate some of this with coconut cookies and couldn't stop until I accepted that it is oil... so I can't be eating insane amounts of it. Very nice that it has good fats in it as well. I used a bit as  moisturizer for my face after it was quite dry and my face was supppppppper hydrated and moist after, so make sure you barely put as much as the size of this 'O' on your finger tip."}
