Excellent taste, and when you purchase with the \"subscribe and save\" option it is a very good value. Our local grocery stores charge nearly twice as much for one bottle. The health benefits of the medium-chain fatty acids (saturated fats) in coconut oil is what convinced us to try this oil. To learn more about the health benefits I recommend the Weston A Price Foundation's web site or Mark's Daily Apple web site as  good resources."}
