If you want to picture us in your minds, do you remember that big dog who kept trying to attack Sylvester and that little dog would follow him around and look up to him?  Well, we model after them.<br /><br />We have always loved Purina.  Our mommy gives us Little Bites all the time.  I'm a bit more finicky than Junior is, though, because I tend to scoop the food out with my nose.  But, hey, it's there, so I'll go ahead and eat it.<br /><br />Junior:  I do love how Mommy looks out for us, though, so I was thrilled when she ordered some new food through some kind of thing called the Vine Program.  It does look very nutritious, and I am happy whenever I see the food.<br /><br />Sweettart:  I am too!<br /><br />Junior:  No you're not.  You scoop it out with your nose too.<br /><br />Sweettart:  Yeah, I guess you're right.<br /><br />Junior:  I've known you for seven years and you're just plain WEIRD.<br /><br />Sweettart:  Gee, thanks.  You do realize that when it thunders, there's nothing to be afraid of, right?<br /><br />Junior: Oh, bite me.<br /><br />Sweettart: Hey!  Don't think I won't! You're smaller than me, remember!<br /><br />Junior:  Oh, yeah.<br /><br />Sweettart:  Anyway, with this product, believe what the commercials say, and get it for your dog.  Believe me, they'll appreciate it... Junior, where did you go?... Oh, gotta run!  We gotta attack the cat!<br /><br />Junior:  *pant, pant* Bye!","Description":"Peanut Butter Crunch"}
