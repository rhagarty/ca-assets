Words can not describe how much this dog eats.  A 15.5 pound bag of Beneful Original Dog Food last about a week (supplemented with junk food of course).  He wishes he could have Beneful all the time, it's his favorite quite frankly, but sorry Great Dane dog, you are too giant and have to usually eat cheaper dog food.  But when you're good and don't bark at Every. Single. Thing. All. Night. Long. I'll get you a bag of the good stuff.  I know you love it."}
