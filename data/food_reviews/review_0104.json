He enjoys to chew on things but I have never thought of him as a heavy chewer.  The night I received this he was so excited about it.  It was so tempting to see, hear and smell the treats.  Well, within 20 minutes the toy was in the garbage.  He chewed off the rubber toy that blocks the treats from coming out.  He then started to chew where the smell of the treats is able to escape.  The plastic fell apart so easily!  He then started to break off little pieces.  I woudl not recommend this for a medium or large sized dog!"}
