It's a very good moisturizer and you need very little, just a few drops smoothed over the entire body; and I use it for deep cleaning my facial pores once a week (google Oil Cleaning Method). When my hair was long, I used it for pre-wash conditioning and a few drops on the ends as a leave in conditioner. I use it to massage my stretched ear piercings and to rub into scrapes and cuts I think may leave scars.<br /><br />None of these things are uses exclusive to coconut oil, I could use many different kinds of oils and fats, or different brands, but why? the bottom line is just that it's a good price for a high quality oil that fits the bill all around."}
