With treats inside, it honestly kept him busy for about an hour as he tried to figure out how to get them. Unfortunately, the rope, which was his favorite part of the Tug-a-Jug, was pretty much shredded after only a few days of play, and without it he's mostly lost interest in the toy. But, if your dog isn't an intense chewer, this toy should be able to last quite a while, and keep them intrigued."}
