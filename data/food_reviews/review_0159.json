He is a heavy chewer and this item really lasts.  However, you should note that the rope probably won't last for heavy chewers.  I purchased small rubber balls at Pets Mart (2 or 3) and put them in the jug.  (opens at the bottom).  These actually work better than the rope for heavy chewers.  Thanks for a great product!"}
