We fill it with dry dog food, not treats, and she likes it better than her food dish.  My daughter-in-law has a chihuahua and a boxer, so I bought another toy for them, but the chihuahua takes the toy into his cage, and will not let the boxer near it.  I have now ordered another one for my son's two dobermans."}
