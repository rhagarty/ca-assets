My cousin learned about Manuka honey, and I chose to try Wedderspoon's because of their company policies: truly organic, no artificial raising of the activity level, etc.  I could tell a difference within three days!  I had my daughter try it and she had the same experience. Stomach pain gone or much lessened, reflux much more controlled, and NO side effects like those with all the various medicines.  I'm excited to see what can be accomplished over time as we continue using this awesome product.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
