Our Spottie died several years and we haven't gotten another pal since. But I am a fantastic dog sitter in the meantime; to the point that she doesn't like to go home when her little girls owners come to pick her up. So I think I can safely say I have good instincts when it comes to taking care of dogs. They really are man's best friend, aren't they?<br /><br />When I had the opportunity to offer a different food to my furry friend, courtesy of Amazon Vine, I did. Between me and her owners, we watched her appetite and it seemed that she was OK with everything. But not a eager scarfing down like she has done with other dogfood. Bingo is a small dog so I don't know if that plays into how a dog eats.<br /><br />This particular brand is supposed to contain meat but if you look at the listing of ingredients, corn and chicken by-products and flour are the first three. Not the best of food categories. It is supposed to contain meat, carrots, peas, corn, and wheat but not in that order at all. The colors of the food is orange, red, yellow, green, and brown. Bingo ate all the red nuggets first (I would assume it was the \"meat\"). The rest she nudged out with her nose, and she only ate those when there was nothing else left. Most of the time.<br /><br />Her owners were grateful for the opportunity to try another brand but they wouldn't buy this again. I personally feel that I would prefer to give a more nutritious dog food if possible. The price is fairly reasonable and comparable at the stores.<br /><br />Until later, hugs to all our four-legged homies!! Peace"}
