I have used it on small cuts and it does heal the skin more quickly.  Also, used it on my chapped and dry lips.  I apply it at bedtime and it goes to work right away; not to mention, it tastes good too. I will continue to buy this product and try other items in the product line.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
