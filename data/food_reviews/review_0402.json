I used to buy it at the heatlh food store by my home, however after receiving the great deal on Amazon I will continue to buy it here.  Since I have been using Nutiva Coconut Oil my skin is glowing and I feel better all over.  I use it as a daily moisturizer on my skin after my showers and I drink 2 tablespoons daily.  I have a very hardy, healthy appetite and eat alot.  For the amount of food I eat I should weigh more than I do.  I believe that the Coconut Oil helps you maintain a healthy weight.  I am so glad I found out about Coconut Oil and I will continue to use it forever.  Thank you.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
