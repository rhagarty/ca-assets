I put it in the crockpot with just water at night and voila!!--breakfast is ready the next morning!  It tastes wonderful--I'll never go back to traditional or instant oatmeal--I'm now spoiled.  Plus having breakfast ready the next morning can't be beat--you can only do this with steel cut oats, by the way.  You'd only get mush with any other type."}
