Irish Steel Cut Only!","text":"I saw all of the rave reviews here and decided to give steel cut oats a try.  But, i tried a cheaper, non-irish brand.  It was ok, but nothing special.  About a month later, I saw the Mccann's for $4.99 and gave them a try.  Unlike the non-irish oats i tried, you can taste these.  These are simply amazing.  Buying a cheaper, non-irish variety is a waste of money.  Nothing beats these.  Amazing and the best tasting oats available.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
