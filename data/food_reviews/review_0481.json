I can't believe I pay only $21 for 54 ounces of it. I use this oil not only for cooking everyday but also I rub it in my skin and I  use it in my hair..I even get compliments in the way my skin looks or the way I smell too..It's totally amazing! Don't forget the health benefits of it too..It doesn't hurt to  burn some extra fat..I highly recommend this product! I love this coconut oil!!!:)","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
