Moisturizing body lotions alone just don't cut it for me. A friend introduced me to Nature's Way Coconut Oil and I fell in love. I mix it with my regular body lotion before applying it. My skin stays moisturized, feels baby soft, and does not feel oily. I have a problem with fragrances in general, and was at first worried about smelling like a coconut. However, that is not a problem at all; there is no scent. I've ordered this product twice so far and will continue to do so."}
