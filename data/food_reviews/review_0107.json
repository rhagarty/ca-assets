Unfortunately it takes him less than an hour to empty it, so it's doesn't keep him as occupied as long as I'd like.  So far minimal/suspected wear (bottle is scratched up and some of the nibs of the rubber chew part are gone) and I'm waiting to see if he manages to untie the knot of the rope (like he has on another toy).<br /><br />Update 6/30/07: The screw on part has suffered some damage. It's almost as if Jasper bit it while it the toy was intact, nearly breaking a chunk out of it.  Looks like I'm gonna have to buy another or find another toy. (So if I could I'd drop my rating to 3 stars.)<br /><br />Update 12/30/07: Now the rope is \"unraveling\" near the top knot and it's getting stuck in the opening, making it hard for even me to get the rope out enough to dislodge the food.  So it's definitely time for a new toy to dispense Jasper's food, which could very likely be this one simply for the ease of loading the food."}
