I just switched to a low-carb diet and this was a recommended product, but I don't know that I would ever want to use anything else! It was all liquid when I opened it up though, not sure if it was just a warm day since it says it is supposed to be solid at less than 76. Really good quality stuff, and that is a lot of oil for $25.
