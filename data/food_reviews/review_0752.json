But put a bowl of M&M's and a bowl of Broccoli in front of a child, and guess which bowl will be empty? It's the same with this.  I mix this with healthier food as filler. My dog is not that active, and all these carbs and fat would make for one fat puppy.  If, on the other hand, he was active and outside all the time, running around, etc. the carbs would burn off (same as for people!)  Fat is supposedly good for the dog's coat and skin.  So, if your dog is a finicky eater, fido will inhale this.  If you have an active dog, this is probably fine. If it's an indoor pet, this is better off as a mix-in, but not as a staple.<br /><br />There's no smell, and the food does not clump or stick. The bag is really sturdy - it's made of the same stuff as those blue tarps, so won't tear, and any opening you make won't spread."}
