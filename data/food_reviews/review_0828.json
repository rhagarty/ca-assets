To me oatmeal meant bland and mushy instant oatmeal.  Then an episode of \"Good Eats\" convinced me to give this grain another try.  Now I eat a big bowl of McCann's oatmeal about every other morning.  I don't like milk so I cook it in fruit juice, sometimes with dried fruit added.  When I cook it in orange juice, I add dried cranberries.  When I cook it in apple juice, I sprinkle cinnamon and just a little nutmeg on it.  I generally cook it in a crock pot set on low for several hours.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging:  Sure the cans get dinged up during shipment.  So what?  The oats don't suffer.  Even with the dents, the cans are still sealed airtight and the oats are delicious.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
