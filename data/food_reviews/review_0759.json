There are many foods out there that make my dogs \"go\" way too often.  And many that make their stool was too runny.  There's also many foods out there that my dogs turn their noses up to or ones that are very enticing to them that make them overeat.  My dogs free feed so that can be a big problem.<br /><br />My dogs have no digestive/stool problems with this food.  They don't turn their noses up to it and they don't overeat.  The variety in the bag is a nice assortment.  This food seems to be a very good option for my dogs and I'd recommend it."}
