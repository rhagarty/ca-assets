I love it.  Yes, it has a soft coconut fragrance but the fragrance dissapates during the cooking process.  I have replaced 90% of the oil and butter in my house and I don't even miss that other stuff.  I add a nickel-size drop to my lotion after bathing and it knocks the ashyness right out of those ankles and elbows!  It also works great on my coarse straight black hair. After having issues with shedding, my hair stylist complimented me on taking great care of my hair.  \"Keep on doing what you're doing,\" she said.  Ha!  I love that.<br /><br />As for cooking, I am in awe everytime I use it.  I recenty made omelettes for Saturday brunch.  Oh...My...Goodness!  They were absolutely amazing with tons of flavor in every bite.  That alone, sold me on this product.  I could have opened a restaurant on those omelettes alone.  (Patting myself on the back.)  Talapia works great with coconut oil as well since it is a delicate fish and one of my favorites.  I was very impressed with my cooking recently and I know it has to be the oil because that is the only thing that I've been doing differently.  I could cook before but now my food has reached another level and I feel more empowered when I cook.  The large 54-ounce jar will be a staple in my house so I won't have to worry about running out.<br /><br />Try it and see how you like it.  You may want to start with the smaller size if you are not sure about this product, or your can just jump in feet first like I did."}
