Best toy yet.","text":"My dog is food obsessed and LOVES this toy. At 4 months it took her less than a day to figure it out which was fine because now we give it to her when we leave and she spends the entire time playing with it! It is by far her favorite toy. When the food runs out she carried it over to us and begs for more. We don't bother with special treats. Her dry food works just fine and from what we have seen, she even prefers it that way."}
