I decided to give it a try.  Firstly, they didn't prepare me for the fishy smell once you open the package.  I had to rinse it several times to get rid of the smell.  Also, be aware that the texture is definitely different than egg noodles and they have no taste.<br /><br />I boiled them in hot water, added some beef base, and the noodles were fine.  The noodles absorbed the taste of the beef base, but use whatever you want with them.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
