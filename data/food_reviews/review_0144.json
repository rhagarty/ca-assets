Was excited and couldn't wait to try them, but my mind just wouldn't let me like them.<br />I followed all the advice here and from all the other sites and tried but it just didn't make it for me. The texture, although<br />not terribly horrible, just kept me from enjoying my meal. And for me, if I don't enjoy my meal completely, is a waste of time.<br />Being on a low carb diet and giving up the foods (most of my favorites) is sacrifice enough. I wont give up enjoying the food that<br />I have left that I can eat. I think I'd rather give up pasta all together thank pretend to like something I could actually do without...<br />I ordered 6 packs and have 5 left that I will not be eating. If someone wants them they can have them free. If you will pay shipping,<br />I will send them out for free. These were not that cheap and I hate them just going to waste. Just email me at Sawilson005@gmail.com<br />and we can work it out. I doubt if shipping would be much more than $3 or $4...","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
