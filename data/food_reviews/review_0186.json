I was a little hesitant when I first received it because it is about half as big as he is. It took him a little while to figure out how to get the treats out but he definitely has his methods now. From dragging it around the living room to standing it up by the couch and knocking it back over. Also keeps his interest for a very long time whether it has treats in it or not!!!! I would recomend this to keep your canine pal entertained.<br />My furbaby loves to have kibble or multi-grain cherios plus some biscuits in his!****<br /><br />*****5 months later and I had to write an update. Gizmo is still in love with this toy. He loves to pull it around and scratch on the bottle to see if he can get at the rope, lol. Does he play with it every day...no. But, he doesn't play with any of his toys everyday. I'm so glad that I bought this for him, it has been a great purchase. He still loves it and loves to play with it regardless of treats being in there or not. If your dog is active, smart, loves to pounce and dig this is a great toy option. Is every dog going to love it....no but you can't get a promise of that with any toy! I highly suggest you give this toy a try."}
