(if you noodles taste like the fishy smell when they are first opened, you havent rinsed/cooked them long enough) texture wise, they are very akin to asian vermicelli noodles, which i personally love. i have seen reports of the noodles having the texture of \"gummy worms\" and \"rubber bands\" which i dont think are accurate at all. but i guess everyones palate is different.<br /><br />all in all, these will be my new pasta substitute. i probably wouldnt use them in a sauce like marinara or alfredo, but who knows..."}
