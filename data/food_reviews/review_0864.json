It is an all-natural product and the oatmeal is REAL. Unlike the weird flavor you get from \"Quick Oats\", this product tastes delicious with no aftertaste.<br /><br />In a week, I was more regular (lots of good fiber), and the oatmeal is very filling and delicious with honey and milk. You can cook it in a slow cooker with plenty of water and get a creamy soup-consistency (I like my oatmeal less thick and more like a porridge). If you make a big batch, you can add a little water and heat it up in the microwave. Although it's fantastic when it's fresh right off the stove.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"}
