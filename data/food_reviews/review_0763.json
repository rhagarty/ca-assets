She also doesn't eat vegetables (the other two do), so she wasn't tempted at all.<br /><br />I don't know what the health benefits of feeding whole grains to dogs are (since some experts are promoting grain-free dog diets), but I base my opinion on the reaction of the dogs. They ate it, they didn't get sick, and they weren't hungry an hour later. If all three would have liked it, I would have given it five stars."}
