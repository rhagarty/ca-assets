It is healthy and does not contain ingredients that add to weight gain, yet it provides the protein which helps toy dogs with loss of blood sugar. I have tried all brands of dog food and found that Beneful is his favorite for the last three years. I do not use canned type dog food because it bothers his digestive system. Beneful does not cause his stomach any problems. Toy dogs tend to be very picky with their food and luckily I found a dry dog food he will eat.<br /><br />Whatever your dog's size or breed, I am sure it will love Beneful. I realize that it is more expensive than most dry dog food, but I feel it is worth it for a healthy diet. My Maltese will eat about one cup a day, so a bag last a long time. We live in a rural community and it is hard to find within a range of twenty miles and I'm glad to see Amazon finally sells it. The subscribe and save program ships monthy, with free shipping and NO TAX. Thank you Amazon and Beneful!"}
