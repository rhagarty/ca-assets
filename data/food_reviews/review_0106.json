I was skeptical after reading other reviews, but here is what I found...  First, the items shipped quickly and arrived before estimated and expected, which is a big plus.  Others have commented about a fishy smell when they first opened the bag, which they found objectionable.  I have a tiny kitchen, and though I noticed the smell, I prepared them according to instructions & I had no problem.  I rinsed them really well, then boiled for several minutes, then put in a saute pan and added spices to taste.  The noodles are tasteless and pick up the flavor of whatever prepared with, so it is a perfect low/no carb option.  Highly recommended!"}
