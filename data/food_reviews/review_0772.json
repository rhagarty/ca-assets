Because of this, a more filler variety of dog food such as Beneful works out well as a way to throw in a little extra nutrition without breaking the bank.<br /><br />The picture advertisement of the product has a large picture of an ear of corn alongside other veggies and protein sources, and that is an apt illustration since corn filler is the main ingredient in this food. If you are not getting your puppies plenty of protein from other sources, this mix is not for you but it should work out for the rest of the dog-loving public.<br /><br />None of the animals had an aversion to eating this product, so I will presume it tasted okay and got a \"paws up\" in addition to four stars."}
