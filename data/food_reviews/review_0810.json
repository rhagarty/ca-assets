McCann's is more like a meal than a bowl of cereal.  The tins are also great for long-term storage so I keep them coming on a subscription basis.  The Quick and Easy variety is also delicious and cooks up quickly.  Cooking several servings at once is simple.  Bring 8 cups of water to a boil and then add 2 cups of oatmeal, reduce heat and cover for 5 minutes stirring often. After cooling, refrigerate and enjoy as a cold snack throughout the day or nuke and enjoy hot. Add whatever treats you enjoy most.  Splenda and blueberries are my favorite additives.  I get about 90 miles per bowl."}
