She couldn't drink anything too hot or too cold, couldn't have certain kind of steamed fish (because of fat contents), and sometimes it just happens for no reason.  After reading some of the reviews here and with her friend's recommendation, she started taking a teaspoon of the honey every morning with empty stomach.  She's on the 3rd jar of honey now, and her condition has improved quite a bit.  Regular bowel every day, and she can even enjoy some ice cream and popsicle without worrying too much.  Although she is still very careful with her eating habit, and she still gets diarrhea once a while, but it was not nearly as frequent as before (at least once a week).  The only time when things kind of went back to the old time was when she was on antibiotics, and it seemed to have kill all the good germs along with the bad ones in her system.  She also started taking yoga lessons last year, which I think is beneficial to her overall health.  This honey doesn't smell or taste like the regular American honey you see in the supermarket.  It is darker in color, and has a medicinal smell.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
