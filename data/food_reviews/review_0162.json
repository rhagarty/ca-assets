He's terrible about destroying soft toys. He's very active (he's a beagle!) and we needed something to keep his attention for more than a few seconds. This is it! What a winner! Wilson loves the tug a jug! At first he was puzzled by it. Of course, since he's a hound, he was following his nose, and his nose was telling him there was food in that jug but how in the heck was he supposed to get to it? He tried a few ways and then walked away frustrated. I showed him how the kibble would actually come out the hole and he was hooked. He spent half a day figuring it out. Sometimes I give him his entire meal in the tug-a -jug and let him work it out of there. He's a very high energy dog. He loves a challenge. I'm so grateful for this toy slash dogsitter!"}
