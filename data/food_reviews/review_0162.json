I read good reviews and bad reviews..but I still wanted to try on my own. I opened the bag and just like the reviews it did have a fish smell...the smell wasn't as bad as I would've imagined..it's tolerable not as bad as a smell of after taking a dump. I washed them with cold water for about a minute..the smell was there a bit. Boiled them in hot water for around 5 minutes and the smell was kinda gone. So I put them in my already cooked meat sauce. Let it cook up for around 5 minutes. I tried just one little noodle...goodness..let's just say I didn't want to try again. The taste well it DOESN'T taste bad. The TEXTURE!!!!!! that's where the problem is....it just felt like I was eating a raw worm!..no I've never eaten a worm..but you know how soft warms are and imagine eating it and you feel that soft crunchiness...that's what I felt while eating it. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat the whole pack. Some reviewers said it was like rubber band....well...at least rubber band has a more harder texture. A worm is the closest thing of a texture I can tell you.<br />Do I recommend this: Of course not haha good luck. I bought mine at iherb (2 packs) for &lt;$4 so I feel sorry for those who bought 6 packs and had to throw them away."}
