We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on. Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- \"Rope\" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it. These were the kinds that we impossible to clean as well.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product. So does Roxxee, our dog, who still finds eating to be a fun activity."}
