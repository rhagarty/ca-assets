While I probably still have Barrett's (awaiting biopsy results)it appears to be unchanged. My esophagitis is completely gone! I credit this to following all the typical advice for GERD ie, watch diet, don't eat anything for 3 hours before bedtime, sleep elevated and I take Tagamet just as needed. I refused PPIs twice a day as is the usual protocol. A few months ago I began having 1 of this honey, on a small piece of banana 20 minutes before meals, once or twice a day. I had a hard time remembering except for breakfast. Yes, it's expensive but I'm sure it helped with healing. It tastes good, too.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
