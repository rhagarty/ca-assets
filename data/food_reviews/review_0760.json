He favors chicken, and normally has a bit of a digestive problem and lots of gas.  Have not noticed any problem with this food, and that's a definite plus.  Not to mention the fact that it is nutritious, healthy and less expensive than the other one he eats.  Another plus, I can mix the two together or alternate them without that dreaded gas!  So happy to have an alternative food for my favorite little boy!"}
