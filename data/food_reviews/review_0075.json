She seems to think it's fun, and will work until she's gotten every last piece out.  I've had one for about a year and it's still in good condition except the rope is gross, so I wanted to replace it.  I ordered the small, which is pictured with a rubber piece instead of rope (thought it would be easier to clean), but I received a small with rope.  I definitely recommend this product as an alternative to the \"slow down\" bowls or for dogs that need extra stimulation.  I have a medium sized, non-destructive dog and this product does hold up over time."}
