The biggest sell for me came in two statements, natural plant fiber and low calorie, what can be better than that!<br /><br />The one thing I did find contradictory to some of the statements that I've read, the miracle noodle does not absorb the flavor of the sauces it is combined with, but served just right it is just as easy to enjoy as you would the average pasta dish.  These noodles are not your Ramen type noodle consistency yet with the right combination of seasonings this product can be much better since it has less fat, less sodium, less calories and fiber.<br /><br />My favorite dish so far is a vegetable soup made with Angel Hair Miracle Noodle, cabbage, spinach, celery, carrots, seasoned with fresh garlic, Vidalia onion and fresh thyme and of course your favorite additions.<br /><br />For a great quick meal, combine onions, fresh garlic, green peppers, the Angel Hair Miracle Noodle with a mixed vegetable, pair with a Cajun grilled chicken or a teriyaki grilled salmon, very tasty.<br /><br />If you have an open mind and a true love of good food, you will enjoy the preparing this low calorie alternative to the average noodle."}
