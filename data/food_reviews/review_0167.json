However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to \"Pringles\".  If you have ever eaten \"Funyuns\" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try \"Grandma Utz\" potato chips, a true potato chip."}
