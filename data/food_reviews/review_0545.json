Instead of putting the dozens of chemicals on my skin that come in even the healthiest of lotions, Nutiva's Coconut Oil does the trick w/ a single, organic content. It smells good, but the scent is so light, that it's disappears shortly. If you're looking for a long-lasting, healthy, simply 'made' product to give you a healthy glow, give her a try. I loves it!"}
