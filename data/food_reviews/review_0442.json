I Have read and done some research on the benifits of using<br />coconut oil. Its uses and benifits are endless. I actually have a small jar I refill for keeping in<br />the bathroom. It has become my lotion after showering. I use this only in the pm due to the initial slipery<br />feeling till it soaks into the skin. My skin is supple, no more dryness, more elasticity, and the best of all is it is antibacterial, antifungus and a great disenfectant. I put it on everything. It dries it up. I eat 3 tablespoons of it a day, I cook with it, put it on anything I would normally use butter for. Its great for high heat. I have read it is good for the gums and digestion as well. The body synthesises it well and is beneficial. I would encourge anyone to read about this and try it. there are cookbooks and how to use this on amazon. Thanks to Nutiva and Amazon for carrying it.!!!<br />Its flavor is lightly nutty and love that coconut flavor."}
