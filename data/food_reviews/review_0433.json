I've tried others, and don't like them, (except for Garden of Eden brand). This smells and taste like coconut. I toast sprouted bread, spread this on it, add a little salt, and maybe some nutritional yeast. Or I use some agave nectar instead of the yeast for a sweet fix. I bought a gallon of another brand, and I don't like it. I will be buying more of this brand.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
