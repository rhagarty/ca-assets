Zero carbs, fat, calories..... Is this truly a miracle food? The pasta arrived super fast but I was nervous to try them. Today was the day. I got the stainer ready and quickly opened one package and dumped the angel hair pasta in and started to rinse. I read about the fish smell and didn't want that to spoil my experience. I have to say that the smell was not real noticeable especially with the quick dump and rinse method. And not there at all after some cold water rinsing.<br /><br />My recipe was quick and easy. Take a handful of shrimp (i used frozen cooked shrimp that I had already) saut&eacute; in a little EVOO with garlic and onion powder. Add a few tablespoons of salsa and a few green olives. Add the angle hair pasta and heat through. I took half of a low carb Italian herd tortilla and cut it into wedges and toasted in the toaster oven till crisp. (This gave me the crunch that is usually missing from a low carb diet but only 3 net carbs.)  The pasta really did take on the flavor of the sauce and lost some of the rubbery texture.<br /><br />The Miracle Noodles are not a flour noodle so you can not expect them to taste the exact same but they are a great no carb option. I am very pleased with my purchase and I would buy them again."}
