Coconut oil's praises are long overdue! We used to buy more expensive coconut oil; but these are tough economic times, so we've been using cheap coconut oil. I read all the great reviews on this site and can't believe that for the cheap price, it's organic AND cold-pressed/hexane-free. We've got another brand of what I'd loosely dub coconut oil sitting in the cabinet next to this brand, and although they are similar in price, that's where the similarities end. That stuff is going in the garbage where it belongs. I could barely even taste coconut when using it. I won't go back.<br /><br />I eat about 3 tbsp of this stuff per day and, naturally, it's satisfying. As soon as you open the jar, you can smell the coconut. And the taste...delicious! If you're already a fan of coconut oil and are aware of its healthy properties, try this brand. You won't be sad that you did. And if you're just learning about its merits, this coconut oil is perfect to start using. If you don't like it, you haven't really lost much money. I \"subscribed\" to this product in order to ensure that I've always got a fresh tub on hand!"}
