If you have to buy online, asianfoods has a 16 oz bag.  I like to get those in large quantities so I can get free shipping. I also go through ebates for a percentage off and use a $10 off coupon from retailmenot.  They're still expensive, compared to cheap spaghetti noodles, but they fill you up for NO calories! They're best if, after you drain and rinse very very well, you throw them onto a hot griddle until they're pretty dry.  While they're getting all the water evaporated out,  you can be making whatever sauce you plan to put on them.  I'd have given these 5 stars if the price had been competitive.  What they're intended for definitely earns 5 very big stars though!  I'm so pleased to be able to eat noodles and not have to pay for that when I stand on the scale the next day. (And they digest better than wheat for me too.)","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
