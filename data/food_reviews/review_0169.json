We have spend hundreds of dollars on toys for him in his 11mths. of life.  He even bit through his 3 Kong's.  This is the only toy that has lasted.  He ripped the rope off after a few days, but this toy is still perfect.  He gets bored eating out of his bowl so now he plays with this and it's the only way he eats his food.  We put his alloted kibble and some smelly treats and he can play with it all day.  I was worried at first, because he was chewing the plastic bottle.  Then I saw that it was made of bullet proof plastic and he's only scratched it.  I wish they would make more indistructable toys because this is really his only one."}
