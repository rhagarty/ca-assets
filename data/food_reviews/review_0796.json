Price-wise, this was a much better deal than buying it at Whole Foods.  It came wrapped well, and delivery was good.  It has a thick, paste-like consistency and a very strong, sweet taste.  There is something about it that suggests it is \"honey with a whollop.\"  The seller also suggests that Manuka honey is good for easing acid reflux, which I have. That's another good reason to buy it.  But again, I don't know of any empirical studies to support the claim that it eases acid reflux.  All in all, this honey simply tastes very good.  If you just want honey that is natural and tastes good and medicinal qualities are not important to you, there are no doubt less-expensive choices around. But....you can't go wrong with this stuff.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
