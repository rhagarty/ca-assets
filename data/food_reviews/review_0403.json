I was always a big fan of potato chips, but haven't had one since I discovered popchips.  They are great for dipping or all alone.  I am constantly re-ordering them.  One note however-if you are on a low salt diet these chips are probably not for you. They are high in sodium.  We go through a case every two months.  If you love them it pays to join the subscribe and save program through Amazon.  You save money and stay supplied!"}
