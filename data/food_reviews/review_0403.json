Wonderful and light and delicious ... I have tried other brands but they have a funny after taste. I substitute coconut oil for all my cooking and baking if I can.. I use half and half with butter to cut down the cholesterol but still get a buttery taste, I float a teaspoon on my hot chocolate for quick morning energy (divine) .. I pop the pop corn in my \"whirly pop\" machine... YUMMY."}
