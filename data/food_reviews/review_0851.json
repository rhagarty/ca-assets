I did not like the idea or taste of oatmeal before, but i have grown to like it. Out of all the brands, this is my favorite. Its so rich and nutty although it takes longer to cook than the 1 minute ones. I usually add some blueberries or soy milk in my bowl of oatmeal. It just makes me feel so healthy every morning and feels like it's a great start of the day. You will see your cholesterol level drop after a little while, just like i did.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
