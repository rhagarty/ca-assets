I use it for everything","text":"I got introduced to coconut oil about 1 year ago and i am crazy about the stuff. I use it for cooking to replace all other oils i used to use. I use it as a body lotion. I use it as a deep conditioner for my hair before getting in the shower. I mix it with baking soda to make a natural deodorant (that works every bit as good, if not better than anything you'd buy at the store.) It works as a massage oil. Basically, it's a miracle product that is useful in so many ways and is sooo good for you."}
