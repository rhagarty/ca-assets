Guess it's good..","text":"How exactly do you rate dog food? I'm not a dog nutritionist nor a vet. What I do know is I have 2 dogs, a long hair chihuahua and a sheltie mix. I feed them typically 4Health dog food I buy from my local Tractor Supply and the dogs love it. I had the chance to try this food for my dogs and I mixed it with my current dogs food as to not shock them. I will say both dogs ran over and chowed down on the food and ate only the Beneful leaving their original kibble.<br /><br />So the food appears to get a seal of approval from my dogs. I also checked and it looks like this food is made in the USA which is important to me. With all the dog food and treat issues coming from over seas I want to keep my dogs eating stuff made in the USA, sure the pet food standards aren't as high, but they are higher then imported food so I don't feel so worried feeding them this food."}
