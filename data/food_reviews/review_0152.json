Of course they aren't, and they aren't meant to be.  They are a traditional Asian food, and if you want to enjoy them I recommend using a traditional Asian recipe such as Japchae (also called Chap Chae or Korean Glass Noodles) - a Korean stir fried dish with vegetables like carrots, onions, spinach, mushrooms or almost anything in season, seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil. Some recipes include beef. I used to make this with rice noodles because I couldn't find shiritaki back then and it was very good.  With the shiritaki, it's fabulous.  I've also enjoyed shiritaki as a substitute for ramen in soup.  So ditch the marinara and get out the wok."}
