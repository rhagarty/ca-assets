The oatmeal that is readily available in the store has been cooked, pressed and dried three times.  This is a true whole grain.  It takes a while to cook, which is why I make enough for the week on Sunday.  This breakfast is hearty, chewy and, unlike your morning corn flakes, it has substance when you eat it.  My favorite way to eat is is with milk, brown sugar and strawberries.  If you are a texture person and do not like rice, you will probably not like this cereal."}
