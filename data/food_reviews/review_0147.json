My husband is diabetic so we are cutting out carbs and I gave these a try.  When I opened the package the smell was a little wierd but you rinse them off real good then you boil them and that smell goes away.  I used them in my stir fry and it was awesome, you couldn't tell they were not real noodles.  It reminds me of a rice noodle.  I will definitely be buying more soon."}
