However by 9 months old she figured it out and loves it! I give her kibble in here about 3-4 times a week and she gets it all out (1 cup) within about 20 minutes. Make sure you are away from breakable things though because if your dog whips it around and tosses it - like mine does, it could definately break something. This is a great, durable toy at $11.92."}
