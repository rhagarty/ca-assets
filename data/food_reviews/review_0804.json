Delicous","text":"This is some of the best oatmeal I've ever had. Keep in mind that it takes over 30 minutes to cook (several hours in a slow-cooker) but it also holds very well for days in the refrigerator. Therefore, we always make at least triple batches and continue to heat them up in the microwave for the next few days. It is great reheated with frozen blueberries added to it. Mmmmmm<br /><br />If you've read that oatmeal can be healthy and a good way to reduce your cholesterol they aren't talking about instant oatmeal. Instant and quick (minute) oatmeal can be cooked quickly because it isn't the whole oats which are needed to get the health benefits. These steel cut oats have Dietary Fiber 4g made up of Soluble Fiber 2g and Insoluble Fiber 2g while <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1LI4\">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Variety Pack, 14.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> has Dietary Fiber 3g made up of Soluble Fiber 1g and Insoluble Fiber 0g."}
