But after a few sniffs, she started eating the Purina Beneful Dog Food right up.  My other dog is less picky but he is old and just had a couple more teeth pulled a couple months ago so if the pieces are too big he will have to quit after a few bite.  But he had no problems eating the pieces of Beneful.  The package does zip close which is probably the best way to keep it fresh and with 15.5 pounds it has taken my dogs about two months to finish off, so I need to keep it fresh as possible for a while."}
