It's excellent for eggs, curry dishes...really almost any meal where you would use another type of oil. As for use as a lotion, it's amazing. Any and all skin issues I have ever had, have disappeared. When I first started using it on my face there was a bit of a transitional period (some breakouts) but after that, I have year- round clear, healthy looking skin. Yes, I am a bit fanatical about my love of this oil but I really don't care because everyone should be in the know."}
