My Boston Terrier cannot figure out why she can't kill this toy. She plays with it for hours and hours until she is panting, and I take it away. My Boston kills every toy she gets, but not this one. I'm online right now to buy one for my Boxer. Boston's don't share well, she takes all the toys and puts them on the bed where the Boxer can't get to YET! Wish me luck, and get one of these toys."}
