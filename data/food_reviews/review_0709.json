I usually purchase taste of the wild but sometimes I am not able to purchase that brand of food due to availability. So we tried the beneful food and our dog doesn't seem to mind it. I am sure he will eat any food but this food is better than the average. His stool is still solid and doesn't get gassy compared to other food."}
