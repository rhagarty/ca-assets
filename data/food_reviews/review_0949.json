Don't like the results on your hair? Try it on that dry patch of skin you have. Not healing it quick enough? Put it on a piece of toast. Coconut flavor too strong? Bake with it as a substitute for other butters/oils in recipes. And statistically, how can one person not be happy with at least one of these options that coconut oil offers? Honestly, this is the smartest purchase I have ever made, I will never go back to putting butter on toast, the coconut flavor is absolutely delicious. The texture is much lighter and it just smells so.amazingly.GOOD. I love how the subtle taste infused into my sunny side up egg, and although I haven't tried it in other foods yet, I'm REALLY looking forward to doing so IMMEDIATELY!!"}
