Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing \"straw grabber\" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)"}
