I put it on after the shower & before bed and it moisturizes excellently with the fragrance of coconuts. Its quite greasy at first as it melts with body heat but gets absorbed rather quickly. My cuticles, elbows, heels thank me. It really does have antifungal and antibacterial properties. I've had it for a couple of months and am not even half done with the jar. As a hair conditioner it didn't work for me because it was too hard to rinse out, my hair was weighed down for days. But, I put this on my now baby soft skin religiously. I will buy another tub to try cooking with."}
