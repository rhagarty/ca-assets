I love pasta but I hate the stuffed feeling I get after eating it and the high carb content. I BOOUGHT these noodles FROM AMAZON because you can get them for a GREAT PRICE and FREE SHIPPING. I'm really don't understand all the complaints as the noodles were easy to prepare, if the instructions are followed correctly the noodles do not smell, and absorb sauces beautifully. I've had these noodles in both hot and cold dishes and they are fabulous. No carbs, no calories, and no weight gain. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
