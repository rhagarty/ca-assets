I was surprised to see it offered at Amazon and decided to try it.  It has the same dense, crunchy texture I remembered and a great flavor. In addition to eating it with some sort of sweetning (brown sugar, maple syrup, etc.) and milk, we also make it as a 'hash' where we mix prepared steel-cut oats with pork sausage and then saute patties.  I also enjoy it simply with butter,salt, and pepper.  As you can tell, I love it and recommend it!"}
