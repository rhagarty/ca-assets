We have three Chihuahua mixes, and they dispatched these petite ones too quickly, so we get them the next size up (small, I think). But the product is good, and they really do help a bit with breath -- although the biggest bad-breath-maker is teeth that need brushing, and there is no substitute for real brushing/cleaning.  These are good as part of the process though. We have, and will continue to purchase this product."}
