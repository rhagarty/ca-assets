I will say - I'm not sure if I buy into the whole coconut oil pulling \"thing\", but anything's worth a shot!  I found that it's best (for me) to put a glob of the oil UNDER my tounge to melt.  Just sticking a glob in my mouth on top of my tounge made me want to barf.  After it melts under my tounge, I can swish it - and the taste is very subtle.  It almost feels like I'm just swishing saliva around.<br /><br />I also decided to start incorporating this oil into my morning cup of coffee as I've seen other reviews mention.  It doesn't really add any taste, but is an easy way to get this in my body - also moisturizes my lips as I drink it!  Yum!<br /><br />I haven't tried any other coconut oils, but this seems to fit the bill - no complaints!"}
