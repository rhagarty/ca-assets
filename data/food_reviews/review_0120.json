All in all, it is a great product.  I've only tried the Angel Hair Pasta version.  It's quick to prepare and accepts pasta sauces readily.  The only thing, is that the noodles want to stay \"bundled\" together (not stuck together) so it's difficult to separate to dish out onto multiple plates.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
