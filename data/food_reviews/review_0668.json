There is also sugar, soy and food coloring. Dogs don't care what it looks like, so the coloring is completely unnecessary. The other ingredients are not supposed to be part of a canine diet. Despite the fact my dog likes this food, it is not healthy for her and I could get the same product in the stores for $5 less than here on-line if I wanted. But, I will not be purchasing this dog food again."}
