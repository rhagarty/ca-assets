I am quite pleased.. I've started taking it everyday and I feel healthier. It tastes so good... I have yet to cook with it but I do use it as a spread on bagels or crackers.. Tastes wonderfully.. I use it on my lips and skin aswell.. It is a wonderful moisturizer... I am blown away by the many uses of this coconut oil.. I'm a believer.."}
