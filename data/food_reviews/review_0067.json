They love to tear and chew anything up!  This is a great toy as it is durable, but also keeps them busy for hours trying to remove the treats.  It is adorable watching them try to figure out the rope\\treat technique.  I ended up buying another one so they didn't have to share.  The best part is we have owned it for a couple of weeks and it is still in one piece!"}
