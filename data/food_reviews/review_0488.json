It smells and tastes delicious, and makes a wonderful skin moisturizer too :-). I use it for baking, and cooking and it's great. Mine arrived in liquid form and has never become solid. I guess my house temperature isn't cool enough for it to solidify but that makes it easier to measure out for recipes. The bottle does say that it becomes solid at 76 degrees, anyhow it's a great buy on Amazon! Enjoy."}
