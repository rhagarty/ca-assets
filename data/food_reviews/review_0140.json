They didn't seem to be too worried about the size once they realized treats were inside of it and it is a toy that they can grow into! If you have a smaller breed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it. Now they have mastered it so well that I am going to have to resort to the larger treat sizes! It keeps them busy for about 30-45 minutes at a time! Overall, very pleased."}
