Just hold your breath and rinse them good.  They taste like nothing much, except kinda like pasta.  The consistency is similar to bean sprouts.  If they were cheaper, I would be using them all the time, but a 7 oz package makes 2 servings-they count the liquid as part of the 7 ounces.  So over $2 for 2 servings, when you can have pasta for $1 for 6-8 servings.  I am not rich, so this won't work for me.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
