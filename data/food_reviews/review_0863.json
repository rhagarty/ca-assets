I did and was amazed to notice a difference in the texture, the flavor was very distinct, and after a bowl of the McCann's Irish oatmeal you are very satisfied. Great with fresh fruit on it and even holds up to adding brown sugar. These cans make great gifts to those that appreciate the \"best\".<br />This is my second time purchasing this product from Amazon and will continue. We live in a very small town and this food item is not available locally."}
