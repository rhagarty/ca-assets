He inhales his food it's better for his digestion to slow down. It took him less than two days to become proficient with it. After about two weeks we stuck this nubby football toy sold at Complete Petmart in the bottle to slow him and keep him busy longer. It's just the right size to fill the bottle yet allow food to flow down. We do shake it a bit to get the flow started. Using this method it takes him about and hour and half to get all of the food out. He still gets to inhale his food and pester us sometimes it depends on what we're doing. I'd reccomend it and the nubby football to go inside if you have extra smart dog. If you google football dog toy in google images you will come across an example of the type of toy we used."}
