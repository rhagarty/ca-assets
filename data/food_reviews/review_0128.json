I saw a chef use them on TV and was intrigued by the thought of a 'no calorie noodle.' I boiled the water and used a hand strainer to rinse them. When you cut the package open the noodles have a terrible sour smell which freaked me out at first because that smell would taste terrible. However, when you rinse the noodles well and drop them into very hot boiling water, they have no taste at all. It was pretty amazing. They have the consistancy of bean thread noodles. Definitely worth a try.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
