I purchased this product on a whim at the animal shelter that we got her from. I really had no idea how the toy was supposed to work, so she really did not use it for the first few weeks.<br /><br />Initially I put just a few Zuke's Mini Naturals treats in the container. She was able to get the treats out eventually, but lost interest quickly.  This toy is dishwasher safe! I put some peanut butter and a few broken up Milkbones in the toy to make it smell appealing and rattle when she shakes it. This made all the difference.  She now will sit calmly trying get to the peanut butter, and accidentally making the Zuke's treats fall out.<br /><br />Other reviews stated that their dog was able to break the plastic, but my dog has been playing with this for a month now, and she hasn't even been able to rip the rubber ball by the rope. As with any toy, you should try to supervise your pet. I would recommend this toy to any owner whose dog gets bored and will get destructive.","Description":"Shredded Wheat"}
