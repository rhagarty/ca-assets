A miracle!!","text":"I was skeptical at first using honey to heal a wound, but my nephew has surgery on his knee and the doctors used medical honey to pack the wound and it healed perfectly.  I had surgery on a pilonidal cyst in December and the wound opened up.  The surgeon told me it would heal on it's own, but it kept on getting infected.  I ordered the Manuka honey and applied with gauze and it instantly started to heal.  Within 8 weeks the wound had totally healed up(it was a deep wound!)I couldn't believe how well the honey had worked.  I am a believer. When my kids get scrapes and cuts, I put a little honey on a band aid now. Side note: I wouldn't use it to eat though, as it has a very medicinal smell and taste.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
