She actually paces in anticipation of her next meal (I swear she can tell time!) Where she used to look at her food and sigh before eating, now she does a little doggie dance while I fill her bowl and then gulps it down as fast as she can (I tell her to slow down but she doesn't listen to me). I know that there are products out there that are probably healthier for my dog, but with my budget, this is what I can afford. She loves it, she's happy and healthy, and that's good enough for me.","Description":"Peanut Butter Crunch"}
