They are edible, not disgusting but not tasty either.  The texture is the worst thing about them.  It is not really like pasta.  No one in a blind tast test would guess that it is noodles.  There is a smell that is associated with opening the package but this was definitely exaggerated in some reviews.<br /><br />I Ate them and felt satisfied and full (I did not vomit or gag while attempting this).  This is obviously a huge plus as they have no calories.  I used Hungry girl's recipe for alfredo with these noodles.  I also added some canned asparagus for bulk.<br /><br />If you are looking for a zero calorie substitute that tastes just like real pasta, then you are going to be dissapointed.  If you are looking for something that is edible and will fill you up, you may want to consider it.<br /><br />My conclusion:  ehhh. I'll eat it, but it's nothing to write home about."}
