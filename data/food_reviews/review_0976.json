It works great on my hair when I put it in and let it stay overnight and wash it out in the morning, hair is healthier and doesn't break off.<br />It's great for my face and a lot better than the otc acne medication, the only thing about it is I can't put it on EVERY night or it'll redden and irritate my face. Every other night seems to work fine though.<br />And it's delicious and really helps with weight loss when eaten in very small amounts.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this stuff and would recommend it to everyone."}
