I use it on my skin and my scalp and in my hair.  It really does absorb fast.  I was worried because when I opened the jar and took a whiff, it smelled like grease...so I was hesitant to try it on my skin.  I rubbed it between my hands then apllied to my skin and it smelled heavenly.  It smells like a creamy coconut.  I love it!  I just wish it would smell that way before it melts, but I love it!  My hair is so soft, my scalp is nice and dandruff free and my skin is soft and supple...not to mention smells so great!"}
