The first is the bargain brand wal-mart variety.  Benefit-lots of food for less money.  The second type is the garden variety mass produced dog foods.  Brands such as Purina fill this market.  The third is the pseudo-gourmet market again dominated by the major brands with weird names to try to make folks think they are part of group 4 which is gourmet/specialty dog food, those that specialize in high protein, low grain and filler foods.<br /><br />Beneful is IMHO as good as it gets in general market dog food. My dog likes it, though he will sometimes let it sit for extended periods if he can find anything else.  As an overweight do, he seems to gain weight on Beneful which is probably an indicator that it has more filler than would be best for him.<br /><br />Given all that, I recommend Beneful if you're looking for a quality mass market dog food."}
