Coconut oil in mac and cheese gives it a little hint of tropical taste without overwhelming the dish. I ordered this in February (the cooler part of the year) and it arrived in perfect condition.  Some others have written that they were not happy because it apparently leaked all over the place.  This is probably due to the product becoming liquid at 76 degrees.  My oil was solid when it arrived and did not have this problem.  I hope Amazon can resolve this issue quickly."}
