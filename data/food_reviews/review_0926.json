I use it to take off makeup, as a moisturizer, as a conditioner, and as a cooking oil!<br /><br />As a makeup remover, I use it on dry skin and rub the oil in for around a minute. Then using a warm/hot towel, I let the towel sit on my face until cool. I repeat the process with the towel 2-3 times (depending on how much makeup I have on) and then in slow, circular motions, I rub the makeup off with my towel. It takes off all my makeup, my waterproof mascara, and my sunblock. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped of oil.<br /><br />As a moisturizer, I use it only at night (too oily to use in the morning), after my toner and green cream. I take a little bit and warm it in the palm of my hand. I rub it into my dry spots (which have sometimes crop up due to my use of green cream) and follow up with a cream-based moisturizer to seal it in. I put a bit around my eyes and some on my eyelashes and eyebrows. In the morning, my skin looks plump and remarkably fresh! I love it!<br /><br />As a conditioner, I place a little bit of it in damp hair and leave it in overnight. After washing, my hair (which has been permed, colored, bleached, and ironed to hell and back) feels soft and conditioned!!<br /><br />As a cooking oil, I just use it like I would use olive oil or any other cooking oil. There have been claims that this oil will help with weight loss, but I haven't really noticed any of that. I use it mainly because it smells delicious!! It's great when making curry!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone!"}
