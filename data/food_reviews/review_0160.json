I love the Tug-a-Jug because not only is it virtually indestructable, but it also keeps both of them challenged during their days home alone.<br /><br />I would agree with recommendations to fill the bottle high with small kibble to start with, until they get the hang of how to work it. Once they do, it is really fascinating to see how they learn and get better. The good thing is, even when they are getting treats, they are getting them sparingly so they continue to try for that one more.<br /><br />I have two Tug-a-Jugs and brought them outside a couple of times. They survived the frost and yard dragging very well. Inside the dogs do thump it against the floor pretty hard, so I would not use this on a nice wood floor, for example."}
