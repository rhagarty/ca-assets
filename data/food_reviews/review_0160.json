Once I received them, everything was just fine. The noodles did come in very small packets with liquid in them.  It took about three packets of noodles to create a pseudo spaghetti with meat sauce.  The smell after opening the noodles was unpleasant, but not bad enough for me to throw them out.  The odor from the noodles reminded me of something slightly seafood-y smelling.  Once mixed with spaghetti sauce the odor from the noodles was undetectable.  These are an excellent substitute for carb rich noodles and have a similar texture and consistency to the real thing.  I'll definitely be buying them again!"}
