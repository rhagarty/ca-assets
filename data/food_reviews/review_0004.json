They're Golden/Lab mixes, so they love to play and are very food-driven.  One of them figured out how to get the treats out within a matter of minutes ... her father hasn't quite gotten it yet.  For him, it's still trial and error, but they both love it.  I like that it is so easy to fill; the bottom simply screws off so you have easy access for filling and cleaning.  It's easy to clean too; I've washed it in the dishwasher with no problems.  My dogs have destroyed several other treat-dispensing toys by simply chewing through the toy to get to the treats.  I've had this one for a few weeks now and it's still in good shape (only a few scratches on the surface of the jug from being bounced around my hardwood floors).  So I'm pleased with how durable it is as well."}
