The dog wouldn't touch the food choosing her own kibble over Beneful. She usually has interest in a new dry food, just because it is new, but wouldn't touch this.  My previously feral cat who loves dog food refused to even try the Beneful.  And he eats just about anything from rat feet to honey-dijon rice chips. The chickens, which are true garbage disposals and especially love dog and cat kibble, wouldn't even try one kibble!  Kind of makes you wonder what they put in the stuff?  The first ingredient is \"Ground yellow corn\", so no wonder carnivores don't want to eat it. I prefer to always buy cat or dog food with meat as the first ingredient since they are carnivores."}
