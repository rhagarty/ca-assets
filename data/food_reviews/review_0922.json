Other than occasional pimples, my only skip issue was wrinkles beginning to appear (I'm only 22 so either I don't drink enough water or I'm way too stressed for my age).  Though the deeper wrinkles have not completely disappeared, they are definitely diminished and barely noticeable unless you're very close to my forehead.  Love this so far! (And it smells wonderful!)"}
