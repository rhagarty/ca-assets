It's a great addition to any diet. You can even eat it by the spoon full. When you put it into your mouth it immediately turns to liquid from it's solid state. It's not \"oily\" at all. When it turns to liquid , it feels like you have water in your mouth.There are so many benefits to using Coconut Oil and I just love the Nutiva brand. The 15 oz size is great It's just about the size of a hand lotion.","Description":"Multigrain Crunch"}
