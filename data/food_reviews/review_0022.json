We recently adopted a 6 month old Weimaraner/Black Lab mix who is very smart and needs to stay busy to avoid getting himself into trouble. From day one with his \"juggy\", it has been his BFF (and a great babysitter). We have experimented with different sizes of dog food (for more of a challenge) and have also discovered that a handful of Cheerios in there with the dog food pieces makes our Joey pup go NUTS until he gets all of the cereal out. This product is his \"go to\" toy 24/7, and we are glad."}
