It has a delicate coconut aroma and flavor. I have only just started using it but have found it to be delicious when making pancakes in lieu of using butter.  I have also used it as a substitute for butter when making grilled cheese sandwiches and baked sweet potatoes. It will do wonders for your hair and skin too.  I especially like using it as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I mix the coconut oil with a few drops of lemon essential oil and rub it into my hair.  It smells like dessert and good for my hair and scalp. Try it with your favorite essential oils!<br /><br />Warning:  It melts at 76F.  Be careful when opening a jar that's been sitting in a warm cupboard.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
