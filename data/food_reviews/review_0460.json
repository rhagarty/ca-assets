You don't have to mix it at all and can use it right out of the jar, but this is how I do it.  The smell is incredible and a little goes a long way... I am moisturized all day long.  The downside is I can't apply it to my curly thick hair as a moisturizer because it will get frizzy, and also when I put a little bit on my face I tend to break out...so I only use this as a body lotion and I LOVE it. I live on a island so the smell of the coconut oil keeps all the bugs away...just how I like it : )  Bought this jar in april and still have TONS of it left..."}
