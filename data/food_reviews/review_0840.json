Plain and Simple.","text":"Have tried several of the popular Steel Cut Oats products from various manufacturers over the past couple years.<br /><br />This is hands down the best we have tasted (and less expensive here on Amazon than any of the other brands we've tried so far, even some in bulk packaging).  Our 8 and 9 year olds LOVE it, and ask for it every day for breakfast.  They moan when we serve something else, like any cereal from a box......even those 99% sugary cereals (actually have some going stale...they won't eat it anymore!).<br /><br />We cook this in a rice cooker on the porridge setting. Takes an hour...but if you plan ahead, or use the timer setting, it's so worth the wait.  Creamy, but still a bit al dente.  Put any fresh or dried fruit in it...along with some honey or pure maple syrup....just AWESOME.<br /><br />Even the cans are pretty and nice....kids want to save them for storing stuff."}
