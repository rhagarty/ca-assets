I use this as a skin moisturizer, hair deep conditioner, I sometimes eat a spoon from my fridge stack ( cuz it does taste good.) I love the smell  too. I even use it as a makeup remover and I use it as a lip balm mixed with Shea butter lips feels so smooth. I have people complement me on my skin tone and how smooth my skin is. I don't tell too many people about it because those who are not aware of any oil benefit automatically assumes its like corn oil or any other cooking oil and are put off by it.  Not me I've read plenty about it and I am never going without it again.  I haven't used used another brand of coconut oil but I will say that the best type is cold compressed coconut oil and organic extra virgin."}
