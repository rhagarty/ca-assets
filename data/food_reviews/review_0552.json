It came solid as a rock, It happened to arrive on a cold day.  It has a wonderful scent but not overpowering. Disappears after a short time.  I put it on my oatmeal with chia seeds and it's delicious!  Will always keep some of this in my house. One jar in the bathroom and one in the kitchen.<br /><br />great stuff!"}
