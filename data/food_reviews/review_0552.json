The color is beautiful and white, and the smell is fresh and doesn't have the \"off\" scent some of the oils have. I love that it is organic and unrefined. I use it in cooking sometimes, but mostly, I use it as an after-shower body and face moisturizer. I rub it all over my body and then after about 20 minutes, use a dry washcloth to very lightly blot the excess off, so when I dress, I don't get oil on my clothes. This regimen makes a world of difference for my \"chicken skin\"--you know, those tiny red, raised dots a person gets on their skin when it's dry--keratosis pilaris, I believe it's called.  As a woman, I do NOT find them attractive at all. So, I highly recommend this oil for cooking, and for a wonderful moisturizer. Makes your skin feel young again--very smooth and not sticky at all. I find the price is great on Amazon too--what a bonus!"}
