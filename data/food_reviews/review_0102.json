I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles.  No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!<br /><br />To fill with treats,  just twist off the bottom;  couldn't be easier.  It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.<br /><br />I honestly don't think the rope pull is going to last very long;  especially if you are buying this for an aggressive chewer.  However,  don't let that stop you from buying the tug-a-jug.  Even without the rope,  it's still a great and challenging toy."}
