Like the other reviews they do smell a bit, not a turnoff smell though.  After you rinse in water then boil for a minute or so the smell is completely gone.  Then I sauteed in a pan w/tbsp olive oil added ground ginger and garlic, fresh parsly, tsp. yellow mustard, tsp. sugar free ketchup and 3 tbsp soy sauce and sauteed with fresh broccoli...was delis h.  I would recommend to people and just be creative with how you prepare them.  Next time I will make Pad Thai love that dish and these will work great.  Maybe I'll use the fettucini shaped ones.  All the styles of noodles are made the same just different shapes to choose from."}
