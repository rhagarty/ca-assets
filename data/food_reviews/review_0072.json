She gets so excited when I bring this toy out. However, she is a very strong chewer so she was able to chew through the rope within a day or so. I read on the Busy Buddy website a great suggestion: put a tennis ball in the bottle to make the toy useful again. This has worked well and makes the treats a challenge to get out. She figured it out very quickly but she is also a very smart and curious dog. My only complaint is that it is very loud on the wood floors! this toy is best if you have carpet or at least don't have a basement tenant in your house."}
