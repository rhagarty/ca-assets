I added Bok Choy, onions, fresh spinach leaves, cilantro, low sodium soy sauce, sea salt, pepper, rice vinegar, red pepper flakes, and not sure what else (whatever looked good that day in fridge) and the noodles of course...and turned out delish.  I read other reviews and followed suggestions.  The noodles do smell odd when you open package...just rinse well and smell gone instantly.  I did not \"blot\" my noodles with a paper towel as I was adding them to a soup anyway.  They were really good...no joke...could eat them every day ENJOY :o)","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
