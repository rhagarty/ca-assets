This toy has kept them busy for 2 1/2 days and still going strong.<br /><br />The bottom screws off to EASILY put food in (I put in their dinner portion of kibble plus a couple bone treats).  The bottom has pin size air holes so the dogs can smell the food, the bottle is tinted purple but you can still easily see the food and hear it rattle inside.  The plastic rope part has a 'plug' at the end so if the dogs try to pull the rope, it closes the top exit and food wont come out.  The only downfall are the tiny plastic nubs around the neck of the bottle.  A big rubber covering around the neck of the bottle has tiny numbs which my dogs were able to chew off- but sooo tiny i'm not worried about them at all (and the main plastic covering is still in fantastic condition)<br /><br />I'M ALREADY ON THIS SITE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY OTHER DACHSHUND.... AND A COUPLE MORE AS GIFTS FOR FRIENDS WHO HAVE BUSY DOGS TOO!<br /><br />If you want a toy that will keep the dogs entertained, challenged, interested, and wont tear apart- this is WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!"}
