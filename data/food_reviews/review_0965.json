I use it to make my toothpaste, as a moisturizer and a little bit in my hair. I also use it on my dogs dry skin. It's really great for your underarms because of the antibacterial properties it has. This is a cold pressed unrefined coconut oil meaning it smells & tastes like coconuts. I would highly recommend this product."}
