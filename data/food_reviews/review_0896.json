It's tasty and with cream and some raw sugar, resembles warm rice pudding.  I had trouble opening the tin (not the first time.)  Quakers Instant Oatmeal is about a third the price of Steel Cut.<br /><br />Instead of a bowl of rice, I cooked up a quarter cup of oatmeal and ate it with Kung Pao chicken leftovers and tofu stir fried with swiss chard.  It was awesome.  I bought this in December 2006 and today the price on sale is $20 so food prices may be going up in America."}
