Just rinse them well, parch them in boiling water, and pat dry.  Then add them to whatever sauce, oil, broth, meat and veggies you want.  Miracle Noodle has a recipe book to download on their company website if you need any ideas.  We usually cook them as a spaghetti and enjoy.  I am anxious to try to the other pasta versions available."}
