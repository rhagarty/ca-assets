Amazon shipped it fast with an AWESOME (new) packaging style. Very secured and safe. Honey tastes very good. I'm a honey person and have tried many out there, especially high-end ones. Some of them give me diarrhea, which is on top of my regular stomach problems. My digestive and colon systems are very sensitive. After a couple days taking this...I feel great (and normal again)! No worries of looking for a bathroom when going out. It's really worth the money..believe me :)","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
