It's not like I ate any of it myself. My dogs ate it. They seemed to like it. But they also eat their own vomit, cat poop, and anything plastic that sits in the yard for longer than 30 minutes. Their tastes aren't very discriminating. According to the bag it's supposed to be a pretty healthy dog food for them. Of course, they eat a lot of grass and wild jack rabbits in addition to the other delectable treats previously mentioned, so I'm not too concerned about the balance of their diet."}
