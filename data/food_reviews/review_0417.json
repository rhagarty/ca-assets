But it's difficult to find quality oil for a good price.  Nutiva extra virgin coconut oil from Amazon.com makes it affordable.  Coconut oil is the best oil to saute with as it doesn't turn into a carcinogen at the regular temp we cook at.  We also add it to our green smoothies, and often use it with a drop of essential oil as an overall skin conditioner in conjunction with our chosen safe skin care line that is much more natural and effective than other things available on the market.  I'm always looking for better ways to help our family be as healthy as possible.  This is a great product to help with that goal.","Description":"Toasted Oats"}
