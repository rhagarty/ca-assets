The smell is warm and delicious, and yet it never overpowers a dish because after cooking it is less strong.  It makes cooking more enjoyable just because of the delectable smell.  The price was right as well.  I could go to five stars if I'd compared it with more products.  Otherwise, I'd buy it again on the yummy smell alone."}
