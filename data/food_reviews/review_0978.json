Mine is liquid all the time (it has being refined/ filtered). I had cooked/tasted coconut oil before. It smells really good, not overpowering. the taste is Ok, more on the light side. Have not mixed with food yet. I used it as hair/ body oil mixed with some shea butter, Its goooood. Just a little wont make it Oily. I'm pleased. It is what it advertises."}
