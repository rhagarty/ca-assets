The kibble fell out when tossed around. He carried the bottle into the kitchen started tossing it and it cracked when it hit the tile floor at the screw end  ALL kibble fell out and it broke into sharp pieces and it was a scramble to get the piece before he tried to eat and swallow them.  You know Labs they will eat anything halfway looking like food.  The bottle is not very durable on hard surfaces.  The same would have happened on the patio deck I am sure.  Expensive for the 30 minutes he used it."}
