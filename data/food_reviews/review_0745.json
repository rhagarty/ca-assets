And she loves the stuff.  We use the Beneful Original as a treat for her.  She started out on the Original formula and gained too much weight.  But I can't say whether that was the dog food, too many doggie treats from our oldest granddaughter or too many table scraps.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, we switched over to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ3HAY\">PURINA Beneful Healthy Weight Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a> and she has it almost all the time now except for occasional \"treats\" of the Original Formula.<br /><br />We feed her two cups twice a day and she is at a very sleek weight, especially considering her age and that she's not as active as she used to be.  She likes both types (Original a little better) and eats it right down.  Because it is a hard food mix, her teeth have remained healthy too.  We've only had to get them cleaned once in ten years.<br /><br />We are able to get this cheaper locally, usually at Target but sometimes at Walmart.  For our dog, this has been a good choice and she has stayed very healthy on it - per her vet."}
