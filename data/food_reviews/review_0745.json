I wanted to try it for my acid reflux and to heal my foot ulcers. My foot ulcers were really severe and after 2 1/2 years of treatments, none of them worked, I was almost ready to give up, but decided to try Manuka honey as a last resort.<br />My acid reflux responded to the honey after only a few days and I no longer need medication!<br />My foot ulcers are also GONE! After only 4 weeks my ulcers were about 30% smaller, after 8 weeks they were closed and about 75% smaller and at the end of 3 month, they are GONE. I applied a thin layer of honey to gauze, placed it on the ulcer and bandaged it with rolled gauze. Change the honey gauze pad every 12 to 16 hours and rinse foot before applying the next treatment.<br />Would recommend the Wedderspoon Honey to everyone, the price is unbeatable and the taste of the honey one of the best ones."}
