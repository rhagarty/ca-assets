I just opened an email from amazon inviting me to review this recent purchase, and wouldn't you know it -- my husband is cooking some up as we speak.  We add raisins, cinnamon, walnuts, and a little milk (him) or Rice Dream (me), and that's breakfast.  But, as someone else said, it is indeed hearty and can be used as a savory meal.  Try adding unflavored yogurt, along with sauteed onions and tomatoes.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
