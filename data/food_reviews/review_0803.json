There is nothing better than steel-cut oatmeal.  For years I hated oatmeal, until a year ago I tried this oatmeal.  After reading about how nutritious and healthy this was, I decided to give it a try.  It is delicious!  I prefer it with soymilk and often add golden raisins and a few nuts chopped up.  But it is just as good with blueberries, bananas, or chopped apples.  Whatever fruit you want to add works!<br />Give yourself a treat and just try it for a couple of mornings, and you will be hooked!  Since I leave for work really early, I often make a big batch the night before, refrigerate it and microwave a bowl of it for breakfast every morning. (It can stay refrigerated for about 5 days and still taste great!)<br />All I can say now is Enjoy!","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
