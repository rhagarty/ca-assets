What I CAN attest to is that this seems to be the sole dry option that my dog will eat.  A rescue, my parents introduced her to wet food and she hasn't been the same since.  In order to keep her stools of a certain consistency and her weight down, I like to also feed her dry food.  This is the only one she'll eat...seems to keep her bowels regular, and certainly she's healthy, and I continue to be impressed by the ingredients.  I will continue to purchase.<br /><br />-DYB"}
