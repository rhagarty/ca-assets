I've even seen dogs seizure when they get switched to this.  I would never let my own pets touch this stuff.  I have found that other vets experience the same thing when they research the diets their patients are on.  That said, if your pet doesn't have any allergies to this you may be all right.  I have found that some patients get addicted to it, probably due to the processed oils and sugar that is included in the ingredient list.  The commercials do well to make you think it is good stuff - I once even had a brain surgeon client feed his dog this stuff so don't feel like you should have known better.  The foods I have had the best experience with is Nature's Recipe and Wellness.  I am also one of those vets that loves the raw diet if it is done correctly.","Description":"Peanut Butter Crunch"}
