His stomach was very bloated and I could feel that his colon was obstructed by something -- a piece of undigested greenies treat.  I gave him all some olive oil and mineral oil and massaged his colon and eventually he started pooping again.  I did notice that the greenie came out undigested!  This product is really dangerous and I would love to join in on a class action lawsuit against this unethical company.  They have made greenies 'tasty' but that is all it is.  a tasty but dangerous product."}
