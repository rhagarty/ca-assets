We'll prepare this oatmeal for breakfast during the week as well but leave out the Drambuie.<br /><br />The texture and nutty flavor of this oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced. Until a friend recommended McCann's to our family, we'd only stocked various brands of instant oatmeal. Breakfast had been perfunctory with oatmeal as just another option among cereal bars and yogurt.<br /><br />We highly recommend McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal. The convenience and price offered through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program are added bonus."}
