The real surprise was cooking with it. It was very very light and untraceable in some foods, yet added a very nice fragance and taste to one of my stir fry recipes. I hope the long term health benefits are as claimed. I am already pleased with the direct effect it has had on my skin and hair. I can already recommend it. Make sure you don't buy anything that's been processed, filtered or has additives. This is the real deal.<br />So far, so good."}
