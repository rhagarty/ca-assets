Not only do dogs have problems digesting corn, it's also a major allergen.<br /><br />Next up we have \"by-products.\"  By-products are things that are not fit for human consumption and are basically... garbage.  Think beaks, feet, intestines, insect wings, etc.<br /><br />As if it wasn't enough to have corn as the main ingredient, it makes another appearance in the form of gluten.  Gluten is the non-nutritous portion that is left over after corn is processed.<br /><br />Wheat is another ingredient that should not be in your dog's food.  Again, it's a major allergen.<br /><br />There are more problems with this food (such as artificial color), but everything listed so far should make you just say NO to Beneful."}
