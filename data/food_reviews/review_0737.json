It is simply delicious.  Once you have had this in your tea, you will never be satisfied with regular honey again.  I read about the medicinal benefits and hope they are true.  All I know is that every afternoon I look forward to my tea and honey for the incredible taste (although I don't think honey is so good with green tea). If it makes me healthier also, that is just another benefit of afternoon tea!! I hope you enjoy this as much as I do."}
