So, we are relatively picky about the food we give him. We have had more than one day of scrubbing out vomit from the carpet all over the house. So, we decided to try this new style of dog food, and see how our dog Jake would respond to it. Truth is, he loves it...and it agrees with him. It is a great dog food!<br /><br />Furthermore, this dog food has a zipper on the top of the bag. This helps keep the food fresh, and makes it much easier to handle.<br /><br />The problem we have with this food is simply the price, which is over 2x what we pay for the other dog food that agrees with our puppies sensitive tummy.<br /><br />So, if you can afford this, get it. If not, find something more comparable in your price range."}
