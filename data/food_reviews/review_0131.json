It took her a little bit of time to figure out that when she plays with it - she gets TREATS!!! Now, she LOVES it! The picture appears to have an actual rope coming from the bottle - it's actually made from some sort of durable rubber, which I think works better. Anyways, I fill the bottle up with a few treats and some of her kibble mixed in when I leave the house in the morning - it keeps her busy for awhile. I HIGHLY recommend this for any dog owner."}
