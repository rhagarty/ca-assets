I put their food in it, and they went crazy trying to get it out. They are both pretty smart labs and figured out how to manipulate the toy to get the food pretty quickly, so I had to buy some treats that were bigger and harder to get out. The only problem I've encountered is that one of the ropes fell apart. I bought a new rope (rather than a whole new tug-a-jug), however the new rope is thicker and makes it near impossible to get anything out- neither dog gets anything from it regularly enough so they get fed up."}
