I noticed an immediate improvement in my skin. It's softer, and not just on the surface -- it feels healthier deep down and the tone is more even. I use it on my face as well. I prefer natural products, so I read up on the benefits of virgin coconut oil and then checked out the reviews here on Amazon. I completely agree with all of the positive things customers have written about this product. It's wonderful and has so many uses that are healthy and beneficial. It smells good, tastes good and feels good and I can't imagine being without it now. I'm hooked for good -- a lifer!"}
