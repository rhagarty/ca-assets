Trying to train my guy to get me a lil' bottle of water. This toy will be the first step in teaching the task that I need help with. I opened the box, took out the bottle... added a couple treats and they went nuts over who could be the first to get the toy... get the treat. Looks like it will hold up well over time. Could not find the smaller size in the stores... thank you Amazon for adding this item to make my shopping easier!"}
