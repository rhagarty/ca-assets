For what these noodles are (virtually no calories - gluten free - free food), they are wonderful. They are slimy, but if you chew them very well you'll be fine. The fishy smell is overwhelming and if you have a bad gag reflex do not breathe in the entire time you are cooking these. I washed them for a few minutes, boiled them, sauteed them with Walden Farms Calorie Free Pasta Sauce for a few minutes. I added about 3 cloves of chopped garlic and Italian seasoning. The fishy smell did go away. They are very filling, but the bag itself for the price is very expensive - this is about one serving. Not sure if I will purchase again - maybe eat a salad with Walden Farms Calorie Free dressing instead for a zero calorie meal, as this was very difficult to finish.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
