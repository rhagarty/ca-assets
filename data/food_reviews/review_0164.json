My dog tends to wolf her food down and then wonder where it all went. Putting a cup of her food in this thing at dinner time makes her 'work' for it.<br />It is VERY tough, and with a dog as hard-mouthed and persistent as mine, it has to be to last. She hasn't broken any part of it -- which means it's indestructible.<br />I'm trying to train her to bring it to me when I say, \"where's your bottle?\" We'll see if she catches on."}
