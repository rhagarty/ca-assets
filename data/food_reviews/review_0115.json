This may help you in deciding what size to buy your dog. The rop and opening ball are the right size, but the bottle is so big he can hardle pick it up (no fun).<br /><br />Positive: this toy has single-handedly kept my dog occupied more than any other toy (other than Nylabones). He is infatuated with it! He LOVES it! He is pretty angry and still hasn't figured out how to get the treats out (which suprises me because he is very intelligent).<br /><br />Negative: After very little effort the rope ended up in 3 strands. It is not durable or tightly woven at all. Also, I didn't buy the treats suggested to go with it, but rather broke our treats into tiny pieces......but it is actually hard to get the treats out! (Is a dog toy smarter than me?!)<br /><br />Overall, I love the product because it keeps my lab busy and content, but if you have a chewer, you may want to consider something else until they grow out of it, because this rope is done-for."}
