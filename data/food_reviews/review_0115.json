I looked at many of the reviews prior to making my first bag.  I did find that they have a strong fish odor upon opening.  This was expected.  I rinsed the noodles under cole water for 4-5 minutes.  The odor decreased significantly.  I boiled the noodles for about 7 minutes then rinsed under cold water.  While boiling, I added a dry garlic rub so that the noodles may take in some of the flavor.  After boiling, I rinsed the noodles under cold water for 30 seconds or so.  To finish, I added about 1-1.5 teaspoons of garlic cooking creme, red pesto with truffles, and a touch of basil garlic parmasean dipping oil.  I warmed the noodle-sauce mixture for about 5-10 minutes.  I admit, the noodle texture was interesting...I guess it was like an al dente ramen noodle.  I wasn't expecting a spaghetti noodle though.  I would definitely make again.","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
