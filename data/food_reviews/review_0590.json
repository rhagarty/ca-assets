I'm really glad I did and that I tried Nutiva first.<br />  I use one jar for \"lotion\" and to put on my daughter's diaper area when I change her. I was very pleased to see that it absorbs quickly and it leaves your skin super soft. I'm prone to acne and I have yet to have a breakout from using it. It smells awesome too. I'm not sure about the effect it has on diaper rash. I think it's more for prevention than treatment.<br />  The second jar, I keep in the fridge (it stays pretty hard in the fridge)and periodically eat a small spoon of it to help my acid reflux (I'm 24 weeks pregnant) and it tastes delicious. It's just like eating coconut flakes without all the sugar. I made a batch of fudge with a quarter of the butter substituted for coconut oil, and it came out so smooth and it tasted like a \"Mounds Bar\".<br />  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I have.","Description":"Multigrain Crunch"}
