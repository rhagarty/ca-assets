My dog loves it!","text":"I bought this as a moisturizer for my Chinese Crested; she loves it! She usually hates it when I try to put lotion on her, but she loves this! Granted, she likes to lick it off, but if I really need to I can just put a sweater on her so she can't lick it ALL off.<br /><br />This stuff also tastes good, smells amazing, and I've used it as a moisturizer as well. I designated one tub for \"cosmetic purposes\" and the other tub for the kitchen! =0)"}
