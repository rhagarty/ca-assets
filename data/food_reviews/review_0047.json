We have been looking for toys that are interactive, as well as durable. This keeps her occupied for at least an hour (sometimes more), and after a week it doesn't show any signs of wear. We do give this only under supervision, as she has been known to destroy other rope toys :) This is one of our favorite purchases for our dog, and it's just as good as the Kong Wobbler!"}
