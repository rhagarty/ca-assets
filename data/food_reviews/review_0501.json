I've tried several brands, but nothing tastes as clean and pure as this.  There is a definite undertone of coconut, but I like the flavor, even when frying eggs or eating it on cinnamon raisin toast. I recently had bloodwork done and my HDL (the good cholesterol) was an impressive 77---anything over 39 is considered in range; over 50 is heart protective).  I attribute this great HDL number to using only coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in my cooking & drinking green tea.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer is a great deal; I really like the 2 pack of these smaller (15 oz) jars.  We're a small household and I like keeping one jar sealed while using the other.  Keep in mind that coconut oil is different than other oils--it is solid at temperatures under 72, so it will look something like shortening in the wintertime.  Still tastes great and is wonderful to use in all kinds of cooking.<br /><br />One more important detail:  this is an organic, COLD PRESSED coconut oil.  Others may be organically grown, but I've found some brands are hydrogenated to make them solid at room temperature (I won't go into all the reasons this is not a \"good thing\").  Suffice it to say that any coconut oil you buy should be cold pressed (and that goes for your olive oil, as well).  Google to find out why...<br /><br />Happy eating!"}
