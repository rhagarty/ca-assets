It's too early to say much, but I wanted to share how I use it. I put a tiny bit in a cup, and drizzle a tiny bit of water over it. Then I use my finger to put it on my face, and it's a lot less sticky than putting straight honey on my face. I can regulate the stickiness by adding more drops of water. I can leave it on my face for a long time. Hope this helps.","Description":"Berrie Crunch"}
