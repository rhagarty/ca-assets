She won't eat a lot of foods, and we've narrowed it down to basically Purnia products. But as she ages, we had to switch to a bit of a healthier choice for food. All of them she turned her head down at. Except for Beneful. I obviously cannot speak to how it takes, but the texture and variety of shapes looks as appealing as dog food can. My dog seems to enjoy it, whereas before she required gravy or some wet food to get her meal down, she can eat this without it. She seems to go to do her business more regularly, and her movements are more solid and seem healthier."}
