I like their food to have good wholesome ingredients, but heck, I'll settle for food they both will eat.  My wowser is terribly picky from treats to food he picks and chooses and even if really hungry, will go hungry rather then eat.  Well, Jack wouldn't eat the Beneful unless I ground up nature choice duck meat over the top of it.  So for me, it was one more step I had to take to get him to eat.  My other dog ate without hesitation or reservation.  The food seemed midland for healthful ingredients."}
