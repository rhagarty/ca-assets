As expected, our dogs wolf it down, just like every other food that they've ever tried.<br /><br />As for the healthiness of this food, it is difficult to tell.  It seems to be a run of the mill offering, similar to all of the mass produced brands.  This Nestle/Purina offering doesn't seems to be any better or worse than similar products from the other huge dog food producers."}
