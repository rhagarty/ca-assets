I had my doubts because my husband never has liked coconut. I tried a Tbsp mixed in a sweet potato with some cinnamon and it was great but I just put cinnamon in my husband's sweet potato. After he saw how much I enjoyed my sweet potato with the yummy coconut oil, he said he might give it a try next time I used it. This morning I made oatmeal, adding a Tbsp of coconut oil. He loved it. He said, \"This tastes so good, it must be bad for you.\" I can't wait to try it next time I cook chicken.","Description":"Multigrain Crunch"}
