I was always tired of many hot breakfasts because it felt like you were eating something that though it may have tasted good it lacked appeal because it had no chew or texture to it. Try this steel-cut oatmeal and see if it is not a whole lot more interesting. Dress it up with a little milk, cream, maple syrup. brown sugar, molasses and see if you don't buy more. Buy a pack of 4 tins and save on shipping too!"}
