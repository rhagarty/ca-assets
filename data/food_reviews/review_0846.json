It has things like texture and a flavor of its own going for it. This is a man's breakfast, not a child's. It's thick, it's hearty and it tastes fine without a bunch of sugar, syrup or fruit, although I must admit, I am partial to adding fruit. Bananas are nice. This tin is an excellent value. If you go to Whole Foods or a similar shopping establishment to buy your Mc Cann's, you are not getting the most out of your breakfast dollar. Buy your Mc Cann's in bulk! You're going to want plenty of it around!","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
