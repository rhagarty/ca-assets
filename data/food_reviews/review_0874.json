I've been buying it ever sence. I like the flavor and the texture (not mush like rolled oats). But my daughter (who is 11) thinks it's the most disgusting thing there is and can't stand the texture she says it's \"crunchy\". But my boys (who are 2.5 and 4.5 always ask for 2nd's when I make it. So, as with any food item, it's all a matter of taste.<br /><br />I don't mind the extra time it takes to make this. But with a family of 5 no breakfast is fast and this actually is faster for me than eggs & sausage, pancakes or french toast.<br /><br />I like it jus with milk and brown sugar.","Description":"Cinnamon Oats"}
