What you need to do is rinse them thoroughly and boil them before you add them to your food.  As long as you do this it will NOT have that fishy smell.  I made some awesome stir frys with lots of veggies and either shrimp or chicken.  I even tricked my hubby and he is NOT into healthy food at all. They are even surprisingly filling.  I love my carbs, but too many make me gain weight so I am very pleased to have found this alternative. I am even going to do the auto ship to save some money.  Enjoy!","Description":"Chocolate Crunch"}
